## Gold Prospecting Origins (1848–1853) {#sec-cowgitz-gold-origins}

The discovery of coal at [Skidegate Inlet](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yAxW9vNFb7fUfdpF9) in 1859 was a by-product of gold prospecting.

The California Gold Rush, which began in 1848, resulted in a significant influx of fortune seekers infected with “gold fever” to western North America. When two samples of gold from the [Queen Charlotte Islands (now Haida Gwaii)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Cq2LC3v4SdSkKiJj6) were brought to [Fort Simpson](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ppad6NUXaQXFVZEq9) in 1850, the Hudson’s Bay Company launched a series of expeditions to investigate. In late 1851, when news of the discovery at what became known as [*Gold Harbour*]() (**NEED LINK**) leaked beyond the Hudson’s Bay Company, a brief rush ensued.

A combination of the single gold-bearing vein being quickly mined out, unsuccessful further prospecting, and a difficult relationship between the miners and the Haida Nation resulted in the rush dissipating by 1853.

## Renewal of Interest and the 1859 Expedition {#sec-cowgitz-renewal-1859}

Interest was rekindled in 1859 by the exhibition in [Victoria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kNiQ5bovGLhER3wX7) of a 14-ounce gold nugget that had been purchased by Hudson’s Bay Company agents from Haida people of the Queen Charlotte Islands. In response, James Douglas, Governor of the Colony of British Columbia, hired “Major” William Downie to renew prospecting for gold on the islands. Downie was well known for his prospecting and mining activities during the California Gold Rush.

Downie and a party of 27 miners arrived at Gold Harbour in July 1859. After a disappointing period prospecting in the vicinity of the original gold discovery, Downie turned his attention eastward toward Skidegate Channel, where he again saw little of interest.

## Geological Observations and the Identification of Coal {#sec-cowgitz-geology}

Proceeding further eastward, Downie decided to turn back when the geology became unsuitable for primary gold occurrences. His report stated:

> “We found black slate and quartz (illegible), further north granite appears and then sandstone and conglomerate and as we were now in a coal country, it was no use to look for gold. We saw coal here but I cannot speak as to its quality, not being a judge of it. The formation is similar to that of [Nanaimo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZoC9FSDpUdsNfcs26).”

This observation marks the first recorded recognition of coal-bearing strata in the Skidegate area, later associated with the Cowgitz coal deposit.

## Colonial Assessment of the Expedition {#sec-cowgitz-colonial-assessment}

Interestingly, in his covering letter to the Duke of Newcastle—Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle, and Secretary of State for the Colonies—to whom he submitted Downie’s report, Governor James Douglas was less than complimentary of the Downie party’s prospecting efforts in the Queen Charlottes. Douglas wrote:

> “The report now transmitted relates to the unsuccessful result of the attempt made in the month of July last, by a body of miners from this place \[Victoria\], to explore Queen Charlottes’ Island.
>
> The adventurers, dismayed by the rugged aspect of the country, the humidity of the climate and the numbers and formidable appearance of the Native tribes, did not prosecute the enterprise with resolution or tenacity, and soon returned to this place \[Victoria\], with the exception of a few daring spirits, who accompanied Mr. Downie to Fort Simpson.”
