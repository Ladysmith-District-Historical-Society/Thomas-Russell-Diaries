We dont know exactly where the _Thornton_ was built. We do however suspect that she was likely built in the U.S. as a single masted sloop in the 1850s.
:::

By 1864 Capt. James Douglas Warren was using the _Thornton_ for trading in the waters of northern British Columbia, calling frequently at the major Indian villages on the Nass River and the Queen Charlotte islands.

In addition to freighting cargo, trading furs and dogfish oil, running whiskey and occasionally shipping passengers, Warren used the _Thornton_ for sealing. 

After taking Thomas Russell to the Queen Charlottes in September 1870, Warren had the vessel enlarged and refitted in 1871 as a two masted schooner – this is how it is depicted in @fig-038.

The _Thornton_ was battered to pieces at Unalaska on Unalaska Island in the eastern Aleutian Islands some time after 1886 (Shipwrecks of the Alaskan Shelf and Shore (1992).

The following obituary published in the _Victoria Daily Times_ on Monday September 10th, 1917 Page 10 perhaps provides the best description of Captain Warren. See @fig-041 for newsprint image.

### A Remarkable Career {#sec-appendix-1-career}

> Capt. Warren was born at North Sydney, Prince Edward Island, in 1837, and came to the Pacific Coast in the days of the Argonauts, but did not spend long gold digging. He came to Victoria in 1858, when the northbound movement began, and has been a resident ever since.

> Captain James D. Warren, whose career as pioneer sealer is contemporaneous with that of Captains Spring and McKay, of Vancouver Island, took part in one of the very lively Indian skirmishes on Sunee’s, now known as the shore of the mainland near the head of Saanich Inlet, and was taking some coasting trade when he came alongside, one of whom asked Captain to go in and anchor, as they had a great many furs and desired to trade. Captain Warren did not care to enter and told them so, but while they were talking, two more boats arrived, and he saw there was nothing for him to do but leave them. He immediately pulled in for the shore, and Captain Warren went forward and saw that they had about a dozen muskets concealed under some blankets in one canoe.

> He at once ordered the men on the sloop to show the natives that were armed, and, when he exhibited his rifle, the chief asked him what he intended doing with it. Warren replied that he intended to do in the canoe, and told him that the first man to touch a gun would be killed and that they had better go away. The natives made no answer, and Capt. Warren informed the crew that he believed that they would get out of the scrape. The chief understood him, and at a signal the canoe was closed in, and the fight began.

> The blankets were thrown off, and every Indian seized a musket, but before they had an opportunity to make use of their firearms, the crew of the Thornton began shooting, and two of their assailants lay dead in the canoes. Capt. Warren was aided by a giant sailor, known as Bill, and a man called Steve before the natives could recover from the effect of the first shots, Big Bill was on deck with a rifle in one hand and a revolver in the other, and was laying about with the two rifles in the hands of Steve and Warren, dropped four Indians at the next volley. Steve was severely wounded in the engagement, and dragged himself to the cabin, leaving the others to fight it out. The Indian pilot of the sloop was taken in hand in the battle, and killed two of his countrymen. Capt. Warren had a repeating rifle, was a puzzle to the attacking party, who apparently could not understand why it would keep going. They forced him through the body. The volley dodged instead by Warren and his big assistant prevented them from taking effective aim, and when the last man in the front canoe went down by bullets from the repeater, they withdrew. The loss of fourteen killed and six wounded, one of whom died the next day. Warren received a charge of buckshot, which laid him up for a long time, but man recovered seriously injured, but both recovered, and it was many years after this occurrence before another trader was attacked.

### Pioneer in Enterprise {#sec-appendix-1-pioneer}

> The captain was the first man in the sealing business to send out steam schooners, and at one time operated a fleet of eight steam and sailing vessels. The seizures of 1886 and 1887 were particularly hard on Captain Warren and crippled him financially, so that he lost most of the accumulated profits of his many years of pioneer work as a trader. In addition to being prominent in sealing, Captain Warren had at different times been connected with a great many other steamships in the freight and passenger service, and in the early nineties operated the steamer Barbara Brockville on the northern route from Victoria.

> He retired some eight years ago from the sea, but continued to show his interest in the subject till his death, and his friends called at the hospital showed that he had not forgotten the early days.

> He was a member of the A.O.U.W. here.
