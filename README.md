## Overview

This project presents a full transcription of Russell’s four-volume diary, accompanied by historical context, annotations, and images. The diary documents:

- Early coal mining operations in Skidegate Inlet  
- Social and commercial life in colonial British Columbia  
- Interactions between European settlers and the Haida Nation  
- Maritime travel along the coast (Victoria to Haida Gwaii)  
- Environmental observations prior to late 19th-century industrial overharvesting  

Russell originally wrote the diary for his wife, Sarah, while separated from his family in Victoria following the loss of his grocery business in 1870.

## Historical Significance

The diary provides a rare first-hand account of:

- Industrial resource extraction during early colonial expansion  
- Workplace conditions, labour unrest, and supply shortages  
- Cross-cultural contact during a period of profound First Nations depopulation and cultural disruption  
- Environmental abundance of the Salish Sea and North Coast prior to intensive exploitation  

It is an important primary source for scholars of British Columbia history, colonial studies, Indigenous-settler relations, and industrial heritage.
