# Pemberton –  Augustus Frederick: 1808(circa) -1891 {.unnumbered #sec-appendix-2}

![FIX CAPTION](img/image039.jpg){#fig-039}

Emigrated to Victoria 1855 from Ireland - intending to farm. He was well educated, and of a privileged Irish family (his father had been Lord Mayor (1806) and then Chief Magistrate of Police in Dublin).

He gained prominence in the colony of Vancouver Island and was appointed magistrate in 1858 by the Governor, Sir James Douglas. 
Pemberton, at age 50, was the right man at the right place when the massive influx of mainland-bound gold-seekers hit Victoria in 1858: he was commissioned to organize a body of police, and in his two-fold capacity of commissioner and magistrate he was for several years the prefect of the city.
