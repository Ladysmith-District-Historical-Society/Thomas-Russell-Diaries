    "section": "Contents of the Diary",
    "text": "Contents of the Diary\nThomas Russell’s diary contains material reflecting the socio-cultural norms and prejudices of its time. It is recognized that readers may encounter material which they deem discriminatory and offensive and that harms may occur as a result. The Ladysmith & District Historical Society is committed to, and actively engaged in, ongoing and iterative work to reconcile our responsibility to support scholarly inquiry with our commitment to the safety, inclusion, equity and dignity of all persons engaging with its spaces, services and collections.\nThomas Russell wrote the diary for his wife Sarah so that she would be able to understand what he had been experiencing during the six months he spent in the Queen Charlottes, away from his family which remained in Victoria.\nThe diary reads almost like an adventure novel with near shipwreck, horrendous accidents and injuries, bush medicine, interactions with the Haida First Nation, whites and orientals, character sketches of scurrilous and honorable individuals, shoddy and dishonest work by previous company employees, a complex and thin coal deposit, a disgruntled workforce, and food shortages which prompted perilous dugout canoe journeys in search of victuals.\nReferences to the numerous whales, whaling activities, abundant salmon and dogfish populations seen on the trip up from Victoria to the Queen Charlottes on the sloop ‘Thornton’ provide insight into the natural abundance of the Gulf of Georgia (called the Salish Sea now) prior to late 19th century devastation through colonial overharvesting.\nDespite his perhaps inevitable colonial attitude toward First Nations, Thomas shows himself to be devout, respectful of honesty and very critical (almost to the point of despair) of dishonesty and immorality.\nIt is obvious from his writing that the Russell family was very close, made closer perhaps by their grief over losing their son, Robert Henry, at age 4 in 1869. The diary is replete with poignant references to his little boy and with Thomas’ longing to be with his family.\nThomas never states why he took the job of Superintendent of the coal mine in Skidegate Inlet: his wife would have known this. The work was not familiar to him and he may not have known that the mining company was in financial difficulties before he left Victoria. It is apparent that he was driven to take the job through desperation after his grocery store in Victoria burned down on July 15th 1870 with significant loss.\nAfter a difficult journey up from Victoria, what Thomas encountered when he got to the mine appalled him. Previous workers had operated in a sloppy manner, not bothering to separate coal from slack, with the mine and tramway bringing the coal to the shipping wharf in poor and dangerous condition. The struggle to put together a load of 600 tons of coal before a ship arrived fills much of the narrative. Beset by accidents, horrendous injuries, a thin and complex coal deposit, disgruntled employees and theft of key supplies, the ship arrived but had to be sent away with a short cargo. Thomas was glad to see it go, however, due to the scurrilous nature of the captain whose actions threatened his relationship with the Haida people.\nAs if troubles at the mine weren’t enough, the ship coming to relieve them at the end of their six month contract was late, causing the group to run out of ‘key’ comforts such as sugar and coffee. This caused much grumbling amongst the men. Lack of victuals prompted two largely unsuccessful canoe trips to seek out food – one to the Hudson’s Bay store near the village of Cumshewa, the other an epic journey up the east coast of Graham Island to the Hudson‘s Bay Company depot at what is now known as Old Massett.\nAs reported in an article on page 3 of the May 15th 1871 edition of the Victoria Daily Standard, Thomas and his party were picked up on May 8th 1871 by the Hudson’s Bay Company steamship ‘Otter’ on its return leg during one of its regular trips up the British Columbia coast. At the time of Thomas’ return to Victoria, the Queen Charlotte Coal Mining Company Ltd. was in liquidation. One final disaster upon Thomas was averted by the Supreme Court of British Columbia (which was ruling on the liquidation of the company) approving a special application made in June 1871 by a Mr. Johnson to ensure that Thomas’ wages be paid out of the first funds coming into the hands of the liquidators. A similar order was made for his co-worker Laiken’s wages. What happened to the others who worked at the mine during Thomas’ stay is not recorded.",

    "section": "Provenance of the Diary",
    "text": "Provenance of the Diary\nIn September 2024 Michael Gould, a Ladysmith, Vancouver Island resident called in to the Ladysmith Archives with two plastic bags full of family papers he wanted to find a home for. Amongst the documents and family photographs was a bundle of notebooks held together with twine. On inspection, these were a daily diary written by Thomas Russell, great great grandfather of Michael Gould, chronicling his seven and a half month sojourn superintending a coal mine in Skidegate Inlet, Queen Charlotte islands (now called Haida Gwaii) in 1870/1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 1: The notebooks which Thomas Russell used to keep his daily diary while superintending a coal mine in Skidegate Inlet Sept 1870 – May 1871. Volumes 1 to 3 with maroon colored soft covers are handwritten in ink. Volume 4, the light brown faux-leather covered notebook, is written in pencil.\n\n\n\nThe diary, consisting of four notebook volumes, had been handed down through the generations within the Michael family via Thomas’ daughter Alice, who had moved to Cedar to teach school and who subsequently married Edward Duncan Michael, a settler farmer, in May 1884.\nVolume 1 to 3 of the diary are of identical type, notebooks with dark maroon soft covers. The text inside is written in ink and chronicles Thomas’ journey up to the Queen Charlotte Islands from Victoria aboard the sloop ‘Thornton’ and the bulk of his stay in Skidegate Inlet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 2: Ink written sample pages from Volumes 1-3 of Thomas Russell’s diary\n\n\n\nVolume 4 is a notebook of different make and size with a light brown faux leather cover. The text inside is written in pencil. In addition to containing the daily work records of the mine employees, this volume chronicles a harrowing return canoe trip Thomas took from Skidegate Inlet to Old Massett in search of provisions toward the end of their stay. It appears that Thomas did not wish to risk getting the ink-written Volume 3 of his diary wet while making this trip – as numerous blank pages remain in that notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 3: Sample pages from the fourth notebook containing a record of a canoe trip from Skidegate Inlet to Masset and back. Written in pencil. Apparently Thomas did not wish to risk his ink-written 3rd volume of his diary on this trip.",

    "text": "Acknowledgements\nI would like to thank a number of people and institutions that assisted during this work.\nAbove all, Michael Gould for bringing his great great grandfather’s diary to the attention of the Ladysmith Archives and for having confidence that the Ladysmith & District Historical Society would ensure preservation of this cherished family document. Both he and his cousin Kerry Parker were unwaveringly generous with their time, knowledge and family histories.\nKimberley XXXX and Kaetlen Bursey of the Saanich Archives were welcoming and graciously agreed to accept the diary into their collections where it is now appropriately housed in the Russell Family Fonds.\nJillan Valpy gave an informative tour of the Craigflower Manor House National Historic Site and discussed the Russell and Mackenzie family histories. Karie McEvoy (BC Heritage Stewardship Officer) assisted with intake of Russell Family artifacts that were in the possession of Michael Gould that are of relevance to the site’s collection.\nThe City of Victoria staff at the Ross Bay Cemetery Office graciously took time to show the location of the Russell Family graves and also to work through the onsite cemetery records (massive handwritten tomes guarded within a forbidding safe) to track their burial history.\nStaff at the BC Archives assisted with review of and access to Queen Charlotte Coal Company records.\nDr. Jan Boxall kindly provided explanations of the medicines employed by Thomas Russell.\nFinally, my son Tristan Goodbody for suggesting incorporating the diary and associated background research into a website. His wizardry with RStudio and GitHub has permitted the cross referencing of material and the cost-effective ‘publishing’ of this material to a potentially wide audience.\nQuentin Goodbody Ladysmith February 2026",

    "text": "Introduction\nThere are few readier means of attacking the testimony of a traveller than to point out that he tells improbable stories; things not perhaps physically impossible, but unfamiliar to the critic’s experience and therefore not set down by him in the catalog of likely incidents.\nThis kind of criticism, however, has the serious fault of going hand in hand with ignorance. The less the critic knows of the world, the more things of course seem unlikely to him and in the long run his assult [sic] is apt to strengthen the very evidence it was directed against.\nI will not, however, trouble myself longer about such criticism or critics. This little diary is intended for the eye of one critic only, and that critic is my dear wife. For her amusement alone shall the following pages be written, and the interest she will take in perusing them will more than repay me for my small efforts.\nAs I now write, I feel rather gloomy, fearing that these pages will lack incident to make them interesting. When a man writes a book and takes certain character for the foundation of the tale he can crowd or lessen incidents at will, but in a diary where\nmust be embraced, the writer is entirely at the mercy of what the day may bring forth, but should one page lack incident and the other be too crowded make them a set off for the other.\nThomas Russell\nSloop Thornton\n21st September 1870",

    "text": "Wednesday 21st September 1870\nWhoever hath parted from a loving wife and children for a distant land isolated from the habitations of civilized men will fully understand my feelings this morning, but those who live in this world for themselves only and hath not such dear ties to leave behind them could not understand, no matter how much I might explain.\nLeft my wife and home at 3:00 o’clock AM. Went down to the Sloop Thornton, found all on board fast locked in the arms of Morpheus. Roused up the captain. Having completed his toilette, which did not occupy more than 5 minutes, he said he would go and call Mr. Warren who is the owner of the vessel. In the meantime he instructed the chief mate to get some coffee ready by the time he returned. I accompanied the captain to the house of the owner, which by the way is not a stately mansion, but what is vulgarly termed a shanty, with one room and a kitchen. We roused him up and then returned to the sloop, to find hot coffee awaiting us.\nNow I dare say at any other time and under different circumstances the coffee would have been very acceptable, but this morning I had quite lost my appetite. At 4:00 o’clock the three white men came on board, the Chinamen having slept on board that might be ready for a start. There appeared to me to be a great deal of time wasted in looking at this and trying that, until 5:00 o’clock when we pushed off from the wharf with just sufficient wind to keep the sails spread. We were two hours in making Clover Point.\nMr. R. Fawcett came down to the point and waved an adieu. Quite a number of whales were sporting about. The wind was dead against us and very light so that as one might term it we were just crawling along; the breeze freshened towards noon but still in our teeth.\nSaw nothing worthy of note, but had ample time to study the physiography of my companions. Before going further, I will say something about the men who are to be my companions on Queen Charlotte, their respective names are as follows; Laiken, Riely, Beauchamp and three Chinamen Ah Chee, Ah Hen and Ah Loy.\nLaiken is an Englishman and a coal miner by trade. I should judge from his appearance that he is a quiet steady industrious simple unassuming man, but from his conversation he evidently considers himself number one at mining; perhaps he may, but that has yet to be proved. The only thing that I dislike about the man are his long winded yarns: he bores you to death with minutiae, he talks about things very well calculated to amuse and pass away the hours. He is a married man and has a family in Victoria. This fact I think makes me feel more kindly toward him than I otherwise would have been.\nRiely is a son of the Emerald Isle; there is something more in his composition than in Laiken’s. I find him continually watching me when he thinks I am not looking at him, but I believe he is getting paid back in his own coin. It would be impossible for me, under the circumstances of our meeting, to form a very good opinion of him. You must know that two days before we started, and after he had been engaged by the company, he was taken up and lodged in prison for selling whiskey to an Indian, for which crime Pemberton in all probability would have given him six months in the chain gang. Mr. Gaston, hearing of this, saw Pemberton and told him that he was under an engagement to go to Queen Charlotte Island and begged of him to let him go - to which he consented provided that a policeman should put him on board and see him fairly started; so that when he was brought down in charge of Sergeant McMillen I almost felt inclined to look upon him as a convict in my charge, to be safely deposited on the distant island of Queen Charlotte and there kept at work coal mining for the space of six months. Knowing that he will appear again in these pages, I will leave him for the present.\nBeauchamp is an old French Canadian, and an old settler here. He is known to you in name if not in person. He is the same old stick and full of drollery, but sadly the worse for wear; time and whiskey has told a sad tale.\nThe three Flowery Kingdom gents are like all other Chinamen. Not easily understood - and I don’t think I will try to understand them further than see that they do their duty properly.\nTo comment upon the crew of the sloop would perhaps be an unwarrantable license. Her regular crew consists of a captain, chief mate and an Indian, but this trip the owner (Mr. Warren) being with us they have dispensed with the services of the Siwash. As the chief mate, who is a little Frenchman, usually acts as a cook on other trips I thought I would let him have a holiday and therefore turned in our Chinaman cook to take his place, which appeared agreeable to all hands and particularly so to the little Frenchman. Mr. Warren is a Canadian, resembles Bill McDougal very much both in appearance and manners. The captain (Mr. Brown, better known on board as George), is to my mind the best of the three. He is an Englishman and evidently had a fair bringing up, but like all other seafaring men a little rough. I have some sort of fancy that I shall like the man; he appears to have no very great peculiarities about him.\nIt is now 4.30 o’clock PM the wind is dying away and the tide has changed that is to say begun to ebb and therefore against us. 5.15 o’clock PM finding we are not making any headway against the ebb we cast anchor off Sidney Spit, about 25 miles from Victoria.\n8:00 o’clock I have been walking the deck for the past hour and have just come below for the evening. Our cabin is very small, about 8 feet square with two bunks on each side. The one allotted to me is not lettered P at the bottom of the stairs, but nevertheless it is at the bottom of the stairs. Goodnight; here goes for the bunk for a season.",

I don’t remember to have eaten such a meal at any time before, in fact I ate so much that I feared they would put me down for a glutton. The ebb tide was still running, and here we must remain until it changes.\n10:00 o’clock AM weighed anchor, tide with us and a light breeze blowing against us. It is very hot on board today; we are just crawling along. Oh dear, this is horrible tiresome work. I feel as if I could jump overboard and push her along. I have no heart for writing today; incidents none, dreary weary work, wind fast dying away and the tide will soon be against us.\n2:30 PM entered Plumper Pass, dead calm, tried to pull into a bay in the Pass to anchor, but before we could manage it the ebb began and drove us back outside of the Pass where we cast anchor at 4:00 PM. This kind of work is enough to make one swear, but since that will not help us along I will refrain. My dear Sol asked me not to become wicked and swear, therefore I will only say\n\n“enough to make one swear”.\n\nSalmon are jumping about in dozens, but neither hook nor line have we to catch any.\nFrom this point we can see the farm and house which belonged to the poor little old tinker who was murdered some months past. You remember the poor old man who used to come round, mending pots and pans. The dog that belonged to him came around the bay and barked at us. My appetite still keeps strong; I feel as though I could take a meal every hour, but instead I eat a cracker and go to bed.",

Thinking I must have been dreaming, I turned over and fell asleep.\n6:00 o’clock got up, partially dressed myself and went on deck to wash when lo! and behold! there sat old Beauchamp with his shoulder out, sure enough. As a matter of course I asked him how he had met with such an accident, which happened as follows: it appears that between 3:00 and 4:00 o’clock he was getting out of bed to go on deck and in doing so struck his shoulder against a box which caused it to dislocate, but he said it was nothing - it could very easily be put in again provided anyone on board knew how. Not being skilled in such matters I handed him to the captain who tried for nearly an hour but only succeeded in giving him pain. Laiken tried next but with no better result. Warren tried next but all to no purpose. Seeing that there would be no chance for him to get his shoulder put in on board, I told the captain to run into Nanaimo. Accordingly, we weighed anchor at 8:30 and headed for that place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMedical Explanation\n\n\n\nSee Friday 23rd of September 1870\n\n\nIt was not our intention to go to Nanaimo had everything gone right, but to have entered the Gulf of Georgia by Plumper Pass.\nThis has been a fearful day, dead calm, only drifting with the tide and a man on board in distress. Had we sighted a canoe I should have sent him on, but none made their appearance.\n5:00 o’clock PM tide has changed, and we have to drop anchor off Long Island, only making about 12 miles today - enough to make one go mad. 6:00 o’clock I had a try at the shoulder, but in it would not go so the only consolation I could give him was that he would have to await time and tide.",

The breeze, however, is not strong enough to make her wash her prow. 3:00 o’clock PM wind dying away and we are yet some distance from the Rapids. 5:00 o’clock arrived at the mouth of the Narrows. Tide running very strong against us, consequently we had to anchor and await the turn of the tide to carry us thru. The captain thought to make a start about 12:00 o’clock.\n8:00 o’clock went on deck, fancied by the appearance of the current the tide would change soon; suggested that we had better lower the boats and put into the Rapids to ascertain, which we did, and found that it would be safe to start about 10:00 o’clock, which we did. We had to pull her through the Narrows with the oars, after which we had just sufficient wind to make her steer. Very cold on deck tonight. Made some coffee at 12:30 o’clock which was very acceptable. Remained up until about 2:00 o’clock; I was anxious to wait until we had reached Nanaimo, but it was rather cold for me.

He came to the door in his shirt and pants; he let us in and in 15 minutes Beauchamp’s shoulder was in its proper place. The moment the joint went in he laughed—the first time for two days. Whilst this was going on I was writing a letter to my sweetheart which the doctor promised to post for me on the morrow. Paid him $5 and bade him good morning.\nTook a fresh supply of water off with us, got up the anchor and stood across the Gulf of Georgia with a strong breeze in our favor. This is my first Sunday from home and the only day I may say that we have had any wind. The sloop thundered and flew over the sea. I knew and felt that she was conveying me away from all I love, and gazing over the side and astern I really did shed a silent tear. The morning was clear; white clouds chased by the morning wind flew across the deep. The waves beat foaming against the vessel; the autumnally beautiful forest extended to the left as far as the eye could see.\nSuch mornings as these bring out man’s better feelings. 10:45 o’clock AM I am now thinking that my darlings are on their way to the House of God, and I shall allow myself to feel as though I am with them. Sunday on board here looks just like any other day except that the men don’t play cards, but Mr. Warren—because he can’t get the others to play—is playing by himself.\nThe sea is now quite rough; the men are all below seasick. One of the Chinamen has been up vomiting, and what an object of pity he looks. I don’t feel the slightest symptoms of sickness and I don’t think I shall be sick no matter how much she may toss and tumble.\nOnly the crew of the vessel and myself took dinner today. Laiken got up and took two potatoes and a small piece of meat on his plate. He went on deck with it, but could not get the first mouthful down; consequently he came below again and went to bed.\n6:00 o’clock PM sighted Cape Lazo. We are now abreast of Hornby Island, the wind decreasing very fast. 7:00 PM sighted the place on Hornby Island where Dawson has taken up his whaling quarters, great volumes of smoke rising. I presume they are frying out the oil. 8:00 PM dead calm and the sea has quietened down; the men are coming out of their shells looking for food.\nWe have made more progress today than all the others put together. A few days of such wind as we had today would soon bring us to our destination. The whales appear to be very numerous in the gulf; wherever you gaze you can see them blowing, sometimes quite close to us.",

    "text": "Tuesday 27th September 1870\nLight breeze during the night. Sighted Cape Mudge at daybreak. This is a beautiful clear morning.\nWe are now approaching the most dangerous place in the whole voyage. The tides meet at this point causing a terrible Tide Rip, and in blowing weather very dangerous for small craft; but we are thankful that the wind is very moderate.\nPerhaps you don’t understand what I mean by the meeting of the tides. I will explain. Cape Mudge is at the entrance to Discovery Passage, which is in reality the entrance to Johnston Strait. Now this strait divides Vancouver from British Columbia and runs NW–SE, opening into the Pacific at the northwest point of Vancouver and at the east into the Gulf of Georgia at Cape Mudge; so that when the tide flows it turns northwest up Fuca Straits and SE through Johnston Strait, meeting together near Cape Mudge in the Gulf of Georgia, and acts just in the same way that two buckets of water would when poured into a trough from opposite ends, when it would meet in the middle and cause a great commotion.\n7:30 o’clock AM entered Discovery Passage. There are dogfish by thousands here; the water is perfectly alive with them.\n9:30 o’clock sighted the schooner Carolina lying at anchor in Duncan Bay (this bay is about midway between Cape Mudge and the Yokota Rapids). Ran into the bay and came to anchor to await a suitable period of the tide to go through the Rapids. These Rapids run so strong that it is dangerous to go through them except at the change of the tide, and not knowing the exact state of the tide the captain thought it better to anchor and see how the tide was and when it would suit.\nWent on board the Carolina. She has been 12 days out from Victoria; she was becalmed 3 days in the Gulf. The captain of her is a hard-looking case. I believe him an Indian whiskey seller and that he has got a good supply on board. We learned from him that the tide would suit us to run the Rapids at 7:00 o’clock tomorrow morning.\nWent ashore, took the Chinamen and got a fresh supply of water from a small stream at the head of the bay. The footprints of wolves are quite plentiful on the banks of this stream. Pulled round the bay this afternoon fishing for salmon, but didn’t even get a nibble although hundreds of them are jumping about.",

Passed the Carolina at 8:30 o’clock; we are doing pretty well considering we have a head wind to contend with.\n3:00 o’clock PM reached Ripple Point. The wind slackened and tide against us; ran back about a quarter of a mile and anchored behind a small island. 5:00 o’clock PM tide changed, got up anchor and stood into the strait. The wind is increasing, but very unsteady—in fact quite squally. Took the gaff topsail off her.\n11:00 PM wind died away; strong tide rips here, making the vessel almost unmanageable. Midnight called the Chinamen up and put them on the oars, and after an hour and fifteen minutes pull reached the mouth of Salmon River where we anchored for the night—and glad I was when we had got the anchor down. I felt rather uneasy all the time she was running. The Strait is very narrow here and there are a great many drift logs about. Went to bed very tired.",

    "text": "Thursday 29th September 1870\nThis morning we got up a little late; very little wind. There are a number of the Yakulta Indians camped at the mouth of Salmon River fishing salmon. Two canoes came alongside; we bought some salmon from them, and I assure you they are quite a treat as we are now living on salt meat.\nThe mountains near this river are very high, but the height not marked on the chart. There is no snow on the summit of them, but their northern sides are quite white. 7:45 o’clock weighed anchor; delightful morning, not a cloud to be seen, but very cold.\nRiely’s ear is no better, in fact I believe much worse. It disturbs his rest and makes him feel quite miserable. 10:00 o’clock AM sighted the entrance to Adams River. Mount Palmerston is a beautiful sight on such a day as this, its snow-capped peak glistening in the sun is really something grand. This mountain is 5000 feet above the level of the sea and is on the southwest side of Adams River.\n2:00 o’clock wind gone and tide against us; ran in shore on British Columbia side and tied up alongside the rocks. This is dreadful travelling; I am beginning to think it will take us a month in making the trip. From the want of something better to do, I made a draught board this afternoon and played a game with the captain and beat him.\n5:00 o’clock weighed anchor, tide in our favor. 7:00 o’clock raining and the wind rising, but in our favour. It is very dark and thick tonight. Mr. Warren thinks it won’t be very safe to run all night, so we have headed for Adams River.\nReached the river at 9:00 o’clock; very dark. I was heaving the lead while the others were guiding the vessel and keeping a lookout. Let go the anchor in 10 fathoms water, but it appeared the bank must be very steep, for when the vessel swung back on her anchor it slipped and before we could do anything ran out about 15 fathoms more chain. The captain would not try to anchor there again, so we hoisted the anchor in and stood out again. 10:30 o’clock wind shifted to the S.W., very squally, and the rain pouring down. Did not go to bed until the wind moderated, which was about 1:00 AM.",

I wish I was there with somebody’s arms around me.\n12:00 PM tide changed so we tied up on Vancouver shore near Blinkhorn Island. This island is in Latitude 50° 33” North and Longitude 126° 50’ West. We are now 10 days out and only sailed about 220 miles—only halfway on our voyage.\n4:00 o’clock PM rain cleared off, light breeze sprung up.

Weighed anchor at 7:00 o’clock, wind freshening from the N.E. All sails set; the vessel is going faster this morning than I have yet seen her. 9:15 o’clock AM abreast of Nimpkish River.

We have now entered Goletas Channel which opens into the Pacific at the N.W. corner of Vancouver, and should the breeze hold up we will say goodbye to its dear old shores tonight.\n8:45 o’clock PM entered Chadwell [sic] Passage and passed the wreck of the Swannee [sic], part of her hull and paddle boxes still remain on the rock. Beautiful moonlit night; we are now in Queen Charlotte Sound.\nMr. Warren thinks it’s safer to run across and make for the inside passage instead of steering straight for Queen Charlotte. We expect to sight Cape Caution about 1:00 o’clock AM. Remained on deck and kept a lookout forward until 12:00 o’clock when the Chief Mate and Mr. Warren came on deck and relieved us.

We have made a good run since yesterday morning—nearly 100 miles, the best sailing we have done yet. The men are rather squeamish. Barometer falling very fast and black clouds gathering up; it looks as though it might blow sometime during the day.\nThis is my second Sunday from home, and to tell the truth I am more homesick than ever. Sundays spent after this fashion do not suit me very well, and more especially when tumbling about in this heavy swell; but I hope, God willing, to be on dry land by next Sabbath.\n3:00 o’clock PM we are now abreast of Milbank Sound and heading for Point Day, which point we have to round in order to get into Laredo Passage. Wind about the same, very light. This is a very rugged coast. Point Day is a fearful looking place, large rocks running about two miles out to sea.\n7:00 PM raining and rather inclined to be squally. 8:00 o’clock blowing a gale and very dark; we are now heading for the passage. 10:30 o’clock pitch dark, rain falling in torrents and blowing great gusts.

    "text": "Monday 3rd October 1870\nI feel truly thankful for having been spared and protected through the perils of last night. I will begin to record where I left off last night. About fifteen minutes past eleven it seemed a little clearer and Warren ordered the jib to be hoisted and stand in for the land. He said he thought he could see the opening to the passage. After a half hour run we got into the place which he thought was the channel, but it proved to be no channel at all, but simply an opening between the rocks.\nIt is almost impossible for me to describe our perilous position; the sea was running mountains high and the breakers on every side of us; in fact we were in surf. The water was perfectly white and appeared in a blaze. The wind almost died away, or rather I presume the rocks sheltered us. Mr. Warren tried the lead and found nine fathoms of water. He wanted to let go the anchor, but the Captain would not let him. He said from the way she was pitching in the heavy sea she would snap the chains like cords.\nWe tried to run out to sea again and shook the reefs out of the sails, but to no purpose. There we were driving about, not knowing but we might be dashed on the rocks any moment. In fact I gave up all hope of her getting out of it, and about 1:00 o’clock took off my coat and boots to be prepared for her striking. Whilst I was below doing this she nearly struck; it was a miracle she escaped. They were trying to put her round when she missed stays and I heard the Captain cry out,\n\n“Wear her quick or she is gone,”\n\nbut God be thanked we escaped. A little wind struck up and blew her off.\nThe wind freshened a little and we got out of our perilous situation about a quarter to 2:00 o’clock. We ran out to sea about four miles and hove to, to await daylight.\nDuring the whole of the time we were in amongst the rocks all the men were in bed except Riely, who appeared very anxious. I wanted him to come on deck and help us, but he was afraid of being washed overboard.\nDaylight began to break about 5:30 AM and the wind and sea had moderated considerably. We could now see that the place we had tried to go through was dangerous beyond all description. Mr. Warren said he was completely at a loss to say where we were. He proposed therefore to run through a narrow pass to the southeast of us hoping to find the inside passage. Accordingly we stood in.\nThis has been a beautiful morning, very little wind, but we have been moving steadily on, and finally came into the proper channel above Bella Bella.\nMr. Warren made a great mistake on Sunday; it appears that the place we thought was Milbank Sound was a deep bay some thirty miles distant from Milbank, and the point he took for Point Day a reef of rocks extending about four miles into the sea. Such mistakes as these shake my confidence in him. We are now running up for Milbank Sound and not wishing such another night as we had last. He proposes to anchor before dark.\n2:00 o’clock PM spoke to the steamer Otter bound for Victoria. 3:00 o’clock cast anchor in a bay near the entrance of Milbank Sound.",

It is now blowing quite a gale and we are near the head of the channel where it opens into the sea.\n10:00 o’clock wind has increased to a perfect hurricane and raining bucketfuls. Men and Chinamen all in bed seasick. 11:30 we have at last crossed the opening between Laredo and Principe Channels and have entered the latter channel; this channel divides Banks Island from the Mainland.\nWe are under double-reefed sails and she is rolling about like a nutshell. We are keeping a sharp lookout for some snug bay that we may run in and anchor. The Captain thinks this is only the beginning of the storm.\n12:00 PM a number of Indians camped on Banks Island fired guns to attract our attention, but the place where they were was so exposed that we dared not anchor in it. 12:30 a heavy fog has now set in, so thick that we cannot see land fifty yards ahead. Wind and rain increasing; we had now to drop the peak of the mainsail.\n1:30 PM saw a small bay with a very rocky entrance; tried to beat into it, but no use. We came nearly going on the rocks; she missed stays and in wearing her she only cleared the rocks by her own length. Put her before the wind again and prayed for some safe haven to present itself.\n2:15 PM some more Indians on shore, seeing that we were driving at the mercy of the wind and sea, fired guns and shouted. Mr. Warren, who was standing forward keeping a lookout, turned his eyes to the place from whence the shouts came and saw a small opening in the land not much wider than enough to let us pass through. He said it would be very dangerous to run into it, but as we had only worse prospects before us we had better try it. Consequently we headed for it, and by the will of God we got safe in.\nThis little inlet led into a bay at the head of which was a river where we cast anchor at 2:45 PM. A canoe load of Indians came alongside and wanted to trade skins, but we were both wet and cold so the Captain told them to come back in the morning.\nI may mention here that the sloop was short-handed for heavy weather, and the men being all sick, I was on deck all day assisting in reefing and working the vessel; so that had I been laid to soak in water for an hour I could not have been wetter and colder than I was. To make the matter still worse I found on going below that the deck over my bunk had been leaking and my blankets and bed were all wet. But I thanked God that we were safe for the present and promised that I would appreciate a comfortable home in the future more than I had done in the past. Men such as I am ought to get a dose like this once a month.",

It is very soothing to see the haven we are bound for, no matter how unseemly it may appear, and it certainly does not look at this distance very inviting.\nThis is our third Sabbath at sea, and I must admit they have not been well spent; the majority on board do not regard this day more than any other. There has been a coincidence with the Sundays during the trip: we have been as one might say on the open sea on each.

Captain Skidegate and wife came on board and introduced themselves to me after their Indian fashion. He is chief of the Skidegate Tribe. I should say he is 30 years of age and his wife about 16. He is not by any means a bad-looking Indian. He is about 5 feet 7 inches and weighs I should judge about 140 lbs. His wife had rather good features, perhaps a little heavy; she is a big woman for an Indian and very fat.\nCaptain Skidegate shewed me his papers (of which he has a host); they give him a very fair character. Of course I told him they were very satisfactory and gave him a plug of tobacco. After a little conversation about next to nothing he took his departure, promising to call and see me at the mines.\nSkidegate Village is about 14 miles east from the company buildings. 6:30 PM light breeze springing up, so we hauled in kedge and made sail. 7:00 PM blowing quite fresh but dead against us with a strong tide.\n10:00 PM crossed the bar in 3 1/4 fathoms; I think we must have crossed to the east of Bar Rocks. 1:00 o’clock AM we are doing little more than holding our own against the tide, but we are trying to make Village Islands to anchor. 3:00 AM anchored in a small bay southeast of Village Islands.",

Got up the anchor at 8:00 o’clock, very little wind, and against us at that. Quite a number of Indians came on board, and a filthy dirty lot they are, but they are in good keeping with the island, for a more dreary forsaken-looking place I never beheld.\nSo far I have seen there does not appear to be nourishment enough in the soil to keep the trees alive, and not a blade of grass to be seen. All along the northern side of Grahams Island is covered with dead trees and a horrible sight it looks. I think I shall have the blues all day and every day; there is not even a little bird to be seen hopping about, and I verily believe if one by chance did come, it would leave as fast as wing could carry it.\nWe are dragging along very slowly; it is very vexatious to be so near our future home and little or no wind to carry us thither.\n3:00 o’clock PM came in sight of company buildings. Quite a number of Indians came off, and amongst them Captain George, a minor chief. He wanted to show me his papers, but I told him to wait until I had got settled on shore. I don’t like the appearance of this Indian; he has small ferret eyes, speaks in a slow measured way, and has the appearance generally of a dirty old lawyer.\n4:00 o’clock cast anchor in Cowgate Bay. Mr. Branch came off to us; he looks rather seedy: perhaps it is the nature of the beast or perhaps he is not very well. I enquired after the health of his men, whom he said were all well, took tea and went on shore.\nWalked on to the wharf where 100 tons of coal was piled up, but did not appear very clean. Walked up the tramway as far as the flat, but it was getting rather dark so I came back and went into the house where the men are domiciled.\nI was much pleased to find a man I had known for a long time: he was a customer of mine, but did not know his name. Had a talk with him about the place, but he did not give a very flattering account of it. This is the man that Mrs. Atwood is acquainted with; his name is John T. Beardsell. He is going to remain with me. Also a French Canadian, Paul Lamerie by name, commonly known as Joe.\nMr. Branch showed me my quarters, but the place was in such a dirty filthy state that I told him I would sleep on board until he was ready to go; then of course I should have the place cleaned out. It was anything but comfortable on board; still it was clean.",

    "text": "Tuesday 11th October 1870\nGot up at 6:30 and went on shore to breakfast; pretty rough fare, but then I don’t expect anything but roughing, so I did not take it amiss. Raining heavens hard this morning.\nAfter breakfast examined all the company’s books. There appears to me to have been a great deal of money uselessly spent. In fact in my opinion the only piece of work worth the money expended on it is the lower tramway, and that is not by any means a good workable road.\nThe storage shute is not worthy of the name applied to it; the coal has a drop of 18 feet after it passes over the screen. Now it stands to reason that coal falling from this height must get smashed to atoms. Mr. Branch says there are 300 tons in it, but it is in a fearful mess with dirt; in fact it appeared to me to be a moral impossibility to clean it.\nThe upper tramway is a shameful piece of work. I cannot think how a man like Mr. Trounce with his experience could have taken off Gibb’s hands as a workable road. It has caved at the last curve where you come in sight of the mine. From this point nearly to the mouth of the tunnel it is built on the side of the mountain and about 80 feet above the level of the creek. It appears to be pretty well cribbed except at the curve where it has caved. It is not cribbed at all here, but simply several long trees thrown down held up at one end by the root of a tree and at the other by a stake driven in; this stake only measures 4 inches in diameter: a match stuck in would have suited about as well.\nSent the men up after dinner to repair this portion of the road as I intend to take a carload of coal over it tomorrow.\nWe next went into the mine where we are going to work. The tunnel is about 600 feet long. I did not much like going into such places, this being the first time I was ever in a coal mine. The width between the two walls of the mine is nearly 7 feet, but the seam of coal does not average more than 2 ½ feet in thickness, the remainder being slate with small streaks of coal running through it. Now from the great quantity of slate that has to be mined in order to extract the coal, it is impossible to clean the coal in the mine as there is not sufficient room for the dirt to remain; consequently a great quantity has to be put into the shutes along with the coal.\nThe coal varies in quality. That near the air shaft appears to be very hard; that about midway between the air shaft and the manway very soft, so soft that Mr. Branch said it had caved here and had to be kept securely timbered. From this to near the manway it is pretty good, but just by the manway it is very inferior: in fact in my opinion it will not pay the cost of extraction, and no doubt Robinson was aware of this fact hence the cause of his abandoning it.\nWe next examined the seam usually known as the 2 foot seam. This is beautiful coal and perfectly free from slate, but too narrow to work. From here we went to Robinson’s tunnel or the 6 foot seam. The coal in this tunnel is quite soft; it might become hard, but it is very doubtful. These tunnels are all driven too near the surface to get good coal. There was a great deal of gas in this tunnel; we could only enter with safety lamps and then I did not feel quite at my ease.\nWe did not go down to Pool’s or Hutchinson’s tunnels; it was getting well on in the day, and I was quite wet with scrambling through the bush.\nAfter dinner got the stuff on shore from the sloop. Every place is in a horrid filthy condition; the floor of the store is covered with mud and brine which has run from the salt meat casks. Came on board pretty early as I was very tired.",

    "text": "Wednesday 12th October 1870\nThis has been a very wet day; it has rained without the slightest interruption. Went up to the mine and took down a car load over the upper tramway and one over the lower.\nThe taking down of the coal on the upper tramway is attended with great danger: the front wheels of the car has [sic] to be placed on an iron sled, then the horse put in to hold it back. The man who is driving stands on the brake behind to stop the back wheels. Notwithstanding all this, the horse seems to have enough to do to keep it from running away.\nOn the lower tramway from the shute end of the first bridge is very dangerous. Over this part of the road the car runs at least at the rate of 30 miles an hour, then at the end of the bridge there is a sharp curve. Should a wheel or an axle break at this point, the man on the car would never know what had happened. I can assure you I did not feel very comfortable; it seemed to take my breath away, but then I wanted to know how to brake the car—and to know, I had to ride down on it of course.\nHave been writing letters all afternoon. The sloop leaves tomorrow. I should like the place much better was it not so wet.\nThe Indians appear to be very friendly, but awful thieves I am told. Captain Gold, a chief of a portion of the Gold Harbour Tribe, presented himself today and nearly bored me to death. He is a big rascal or I am very much deceived. He is just the sort of man you might take and hang upon his looks. He says his wife is a queen: Mr. Trounce told him that he was a king and of course Mrs. Gold must be a queen. He does not take it amiss if you address her as Mrs. Gold, but is very indignant if you call her a Klootchman. But she is only a Klootchman nevertheless, and he is a Siwash to my mind in the true sense of the word.",

    "text": "Friday 14th October 1870\nThis has been a warm day but showery.\nFinished cleaning the coal on wharf about 10:00 o’clock AM. Sent Laiken and Beardsell up with the car to bring down coal from the shute. I gave Laiken charge of the car as he has been accustomed to such work, at the same time telling him where to brake it and to pull on the handle of the brake when he came to the curve at the end of the bridge so as to ease her round. He sneered at the idea of me telling him how to work a road of that sort. He said he had worked too many roads to require instruction as to how this one ought to be worked. I simply told him that I was very glad he was so competent. Consequently, they jumped into the car and drove up.\nAfter a lapse of 30 minutes I began to fear that something had gone wrong and had just started to go up when an Indian came galloping down on the horse and said that Laiken had got killed by falling from the car. I cannot describe my feelings at that moment. My heart seemed to stand still at such sad tidings, but immediately ran back to the house, got some brandy, lint and tincture of Arnic; I did this in hopes that things were not so bad as represented.\nWhen I arrived at the place where the accident occurred I was greatly relieved to find that he was not killed. Beardsell had been bathing his face with water and had got him round. I administered a little weak brandy and water, which revived him considerably. I next examined his wounds, and found his skull badly fractured on the left side. There were two cuts about two inches long running at right angles and crossing each other. His left shoulder was badly bruised. I was afraid that the arm was broken, but that I could not tell until we had him undressed. We got him home as quick as possible.\nI cut the hair from the wounded parts of his head, washed the sand out of the cuts and then applied a piece of lint saturated with tincture of Arnica. I had great difficulty in stopping the bleeding; by 5:00 o’clock however the bleeding had ceased entirely and at 8:00 o’clock I saturated the lint again with Arnica, this I did from the outside without removing it. His shoulder I bathed well with painkiller which seemed to remove the pain. His arm was all right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMedical Explanation\n\n\n\nSee Friday 14th of October 1870\n\n\nUnfortunate as this accident has been, I feel truly thankful that he was not killed. How he escaped is more than I can tell. Beardsell who was on the car with him did not see how it occurred; he only saw that he was gone from the car. He immediately jumped onto the brake and brought the car up as soon as possible, but which he could not accomplish until he reached the flat, a distance of about 600 yards from where the accident happened. He immediately repaired to the spot and found Laiken lying insensible and to all appearance dead.\nLaiken said he slipped from the footboard and fell, but I am inclined to think that he got frightened that the car was running away and jumped off. If this be the correct solution of the matter, it was next to lunacy to do such a thing.\nThere are now two men on the sick list and Beauchamp worth little or nothing; a bad beginning indeed, it makes me feel quite despondent.\nBeardsell said he was not afraid to run the car provided I would go with him and keep a lookout as he could not see very well. I did not much like the idea, but of course I had to go: the coal had to be got down somehow. Consequently after dinner we went up and took down four cars; it is not by any means enviable work.",

The brakes however are very inefficient, having very little power in wet or frosty weather.\nThe coal as I anticipated is in a dreadful mess; it is so wet that it is hardly possible to tell coal from slate. There is also a great deal of small in it. Have ordered Beauchamp to make a screen. This cleaning will be a tedious and expensive job, and the coal when finished will not (to my mind) be marketable. Branch erred very much by not cleaning it during the summer when it was dry: it could have then been made perfectly clean at 1/4 the cost. The only man who understands cleaning the coal at present is Lamerie; the Chinamen are worse than the Indians at it, but I daresay they will improve.\nThe Indians are a great nuisance from being so near us: they are eternally prying about for something to steal. You cannot leave the smallest thing out of your hands for 5 minutes; some of them will be sure to pick it up.",

Beardsell found that as the day wore on she was gradually becoming more unmanageable: the leather on the brakes had become perfectly soaked with the rain, consequently they had but little power over the wheels.\nI was standing about halfway down the wharf when she came down. I could see as soon as she came on to the wharf that it was impossible to bring her up. I therefore called to Beardsell to jump off and let her go, but he held onto the brake until he came to where the one track runs into the other; then he jumped off, but the cross rail caught his foot and threw him down bruising his right thigh and knee. I think he will be ready for work again in a couple of days, and it will take that time to repair the car. It was very amusing to see the Indians rushing down for the wharf; they expected to find the man killed.\nI had a call from Captain Skaylus today; he is another minor chief. I read over his papers: they gave him an exceedingly good character, and he certainly has the best countenance of any Indian I have yet seen here. It appears he was the owner of the land now held by the Company. He expressed himself well satisfied with the treatment he had received at the hands of the Company.\nI forgot to mention that on reading over Captain Gold’s papers—which by the way don’t speak very highly of him—I saw one he had received from N.C. Bailey when he was at Gold Harbour. In one portion of it Bailey thanked God that the Captain was about to leave them as he had been the plague of their life.",

The quarrel arose out of nothing, but old sores were brought up. Laiken is the foulest mouthed man I ever heard. The oaths that he uses are something fearful. May God keep me from ever having such a foul tongue as that man.\nUpon the whole I have got a pretty crowd of men.

The poor little imps keep whistling into their hands making a noise like so many seagulls.\nI went down to the beach and inquired the reason of such treatment: they said it made them strong and hardy men. I tried to remonstrate with them, that were they to go in and take a dip and come out immediately and keep it up every morning they would obtain their desire, but to keep them in half an hour would only tend to impair their health by giving them colds.

The old women are great beggars and the young ones are very immodest.\nIn one of the huts there was a pretty girl for an Indian; her name is Kindawash. Her features are so regular that she is quite an exception amongst them. From her appearance I should have taken her to be about 11 years of age. I asked her if she knew how old she was. She replied no, but she had been three years a woman; but the manner in which she described her arrival at womanhood made me blush. She detected this and inquired what was the matter.

His papers give him a very good character, and I should say he is deserving of it from his looks. He appears to be a good-natured happy soul, always laughing; it is quite refreshing to meet an Indian of this description. He speaks Chinook very indifferently. When speaking of himself, he always uses the first person pronoun both in English and Chinook (Nika, me): I presume he thinks he cannot express it too clearly so he gives both.\nI think he is about 35 years of age and his present wife about 15 years. He has a grown up family by his first wife but no issue as yet by the second. She has a baby nevertheless about 3 months old, a little half breed. It looks a very weakly child.

It appears she was standing all right alongside of the track to keep out of the way of the car when an Indian woman who was in the bush tried to drive her away, but instead of doing so she drove her onto the track. Beauchamp tried to bring the car up, but no use. The front part of the car struck her on the shoulder, threw her off the track and broke the far hind leg below the knee. I loaded one of the rifles and told an Indian to shoot her. Poor brute, I had not the heart to do it myself, but I knew it would end her misery.\nThere is no one to blame for this accident; the Indian woman’s intentions were good enough and Beauchamp did his best to stop the car.",

He says a great deal of work has to be done in the mine before they can begin to extract coal; he also says that the mine is partly ruined from the manner in which it has hitherto been managed.\nOne month today since we landed, and very little work to show for the time.

    "text": "Sunday 13th November 1870\nThis has been a beautiful day, only one shower.\nTook a walk round Shallow Bay and visited the grave of the poor fellow who was drowned whilst bathing in ’66. He is buried quite close to the beach, with a small fence round the grave. The top of the grave is quite bare, not even a blade of grass on it. It looked so desolate that I quite shuddered at the thought of being left in such a place, but I trust that God will spare me to return from here. I have heard some men say they did not care where they were laid after they were dead, but I think if such men saw the loneliness of this poor man’s grave they would think very differently.\nHad a call from Captain Scotchguy today. He said he was going to give a dance and feast to his friends in the evening, and kindly invited me to come which I accepted—not to join in the dance of course, but simply to look on.\nYou will say not proper kind of amusement for a Sabbath evening, but to my mind there is no more harm in it than sitting in the house. These poor Indians have no more regard for the Sabbath than any other day, and they are better amusing themselves in this way than going about stealing.\nWhen I entered I was shown to a seat next to mine host, which was near to the door on the left hand side going in. Next to him were seated, in a row, all the other chiefs and old men. On the opposite side sat the band in a square. The only instruments of music they possessed were a large and small drum (these drums having only one end) several rattles and crackers. An elderly man sat outside of the square with a stick in his hand; he was the conductor, and he beat time for them.\nThe music to my fancy only makes a din, but the singing is very beautiful: the men and women kept such good time that it was really worth hearing. The females were placed at the far end of the hut opposite the door and hidden from view by a sheet being hung up in front of them.\nShortly after I entered, the dancers arrived at the door and gave a whoop; the band and singing began and the dancers entered headed by a naked man and boy. These two crawled round and round the fire and twisted their features into all kinds of shapes. The others were dressed in all sorts of costumes, but all had feathers in their hair. This was kept up for 10 minutes when the two nude gentlemen made their exit behind the sheet amongst the females.\nIn about 5 minutes they reappeared, dressed, the man wearing a mask which stands about 6 inches above the head; there is a cavity on top which is filled with small feathers so that every time he shakes his head, a quantity fly out and all over the hut. As soon as he appeared, the singing and band struck up again. He took his place in the centre of the square and danced away until the perspiration rolled off him.\nThere was another intermission of about 5 minutes, when dancing was resumed by another Indian and kept up for an hour. After this the boys formed themselves into a square and danced for half an hour. This completed the ball part of the entertainment.\nNext came the feast. One peculiarity I observed in this was that neither the chief (who was giving the fête) the members of his family, the women nor the young people partook of the Muckmuck. Only the chiefs, old men, band and dancers.\nThe first course was boiled potatoes straight. Captain Gold, being the greatest chief present, was served first and with the greater quantity; his dish was a wash hand basin. Then the other chiefs, old men etc.; the vessels chiefly used at this feast were wash hand basins and chambers.\nAfter they had eaten a quantity of these potatoes, a bucket of water was handed round, and each took a drink. The potatoes remaining in the several vessels were removed to the respective huts of the guests, emptied out and brought back and placed again ready for the second course which consisted of biscuit and molasses. The biscuit were put in first, then a man came round with a tin and poured the molasses over them (I declined the molasses preferring the biscuit straight — the tin looking rather suspicious). The fragments of this course were treated the same as the first.\nA piece of tobacco (about two ounces) was handed to each. They all filled their pipes, took a smoke and then their departure without saying goodnight, but like so many beasts that had turned out feed and were now returning to their lair.",

The men who planned and constructed the upper road surely never had seen a coal mine, or knew the requirement of one.\nAs it is at present constructed, the car when run out from the tunnel is dumped into a small shed where it has to be cleaned, and being so mixed up with slate and dust it is not a matter of taking the dirt from the coal, but the coal from the dirt. Consequently, every piece of coal has to be picked up by hand and thrown onto the heap, then the dirt has to be shoveled over the bank. Crystallized carbon would hardly pay if worked after this fashion.\nThere ought to have been a small shute with a screen in it at the mouth of the tunnel.

One can get quite a quantity of sewing done for a small piece of tobacco, and I must say I detest sitting down to sew myself when I can get it done so cheaply.\nThe girl asked me when she went away if I would always employ her when I wanted any sewing done.

He maintains that he is the rightful owner of the lands held by the Company and that he was paid the least of all the chiefs. He therefore says he has still a claim upon the Company. I asked him to allow me to examine his papers again, which he did.\nHe has a paper from Mr. Robinson (who settled the Indians claim for the Company) which clearly shows that he had no claim upon the lands whatever. Robinson’s assertion is based upon information received from the other chiefs, consequently it must be correct. I explained this to him and told him that the Company had given him 15 blankets and a cultaz potlatch, because he was a minor chief. He asked me if such was the tenure of the paper given him by Robinson. I told him it was, upon which information he became quite furious, and threatened to burn it. He said the other Indians were liars and no better than dogs, but that he was the same as a white man; he would not steal nor lie.\nNow in my opinion Indians have no veracity and as to thieving, a red hot stove would not be too heavy for Captain Gold. I did not tell him this however, but simply that if there was any mistake, it did not rest with Mr. Robinson or the Company but with the Indians.\nHe has a very flattering paper from Mr. Trounce; had he been Lord of the Highlands he could not have said more of him than he has done. Quite a mistake as it is apt to mislead the unsuspecting stranger.\nIt appears from all I can learn from Captain Gold and the other Indians that Trounce told them that he was the owner of the mine, that he possessed a large stone house in Victoria, that his social standing was next to the Governor of the Colony, and that his father was a large ship owner, one of which was to be sent here for coal and that it would carry hither a cargo of Iktas (goods) to be distributed amongst the Indians as a Cultaz potlatch, Gold to receive the largest quantity, and that the said ship would have four masts.\nI explained to him that Mister Trounce was merely a servant of the Company whilst he was here and that he was not quite such a “Big Bug” as he professed to be. Also that I had no doubt when his father’s ship with the four masts arrived that they would get a big potlatch, but when she would come I could not tell. I assured him that the Company had no intentions of giving a potlatch and Trounce had no authority to insinuate that they would do so. He asked me to give him a paper which I did, a copy of which will appear at the beginning of the next volume as there is not sufficient room to contain it in this.",

The scoundrel does this in order to enlist the sympathies of those who don’t know him, and to wring out of you all that he can.\nYou may then go to the devil for aught that he cares, until his unsatiable thirst for begging prompts him to return, when he will attempt to twist that cut-throat countenance of his into (what he thinks) the semblance of the very essence of purity, but Ah! Beware! for he is an oily dog. He takes a great pride in presenting his papers to all newcomers, and at such times puts on a most majestic air and expects you to pull off your coat and give it to him, for the good character he bears through the medium of these papers.\nSince it has been customary upon such occasions to acknowledge his good qualities by a potlatch, give him a “quid” of tobacco; at the same time impress him very forcibly that you give it to him not because he requires it, but simply because he is such a good man (“over the left”).\nIn speaking to him of his worthy spouse, you must be very careful not to hurt his dignity by calling her a Klootchman; it appears that someone has impressed him with the idea that he is a King, and of course as a necessary consequence his wife is a Queen; you must therefore make mention of her as his wife or Queen Gold!!!\nThomas Russell Superintendent Queen Charlotte Coal Mining Company P.S. I have unwittingly been very remiss. Amongst the Captain’s good qualities there is one which I have omitted viz; that he is not by any means a thief: he only appropriates for his own use anything that he can lay his hands upon.\nHe does this in a very delicate manner, always taking great care that he is not observed by the other Indians. He will tell you that he is not the same as other Indians, that is to say he does not lie nor steal (what a liar!) not even prowl about at night, but he boldly asserts that the other Indians are like dogs, continually prowling about at night to see what they can pick up.\n- TR",

It is something very grand to watch the rising sun light up these mountain peaks. Today has been quite a treat, not a cloud to be seen. The sun, however, only strikes on portions of the track; the high mountains and trees hide old Sol from us. During the winter season the sun never shines on the house where we live (Trounce’s Cottage gets a little blink about 11:00 o’clock) . This adds to the dreariness of the place, and from the incessant rains the houses are very damp.\nThe Indian dogs are a great nuisance; they are continually chasing and biting the pigs, in fact they killed one three days ago. I warned the Indians about their dogs and told them if I saw any of them chasing the pigs I would shoot them. They very cooly replied that if I shot the dogs they would shoot the pigs. The Indians are too saucy by half: we sadly want a gunboat to give them a shaking up. When I first arrived here I found the car standing with one wheel off, and upon inquiring why, Branch told me that he had to do so to prevent the Indians from pushing her up the track and then riding down in her. They were in the habit of doing this after the men had gone to bed, and when he told them to desist they only laughed at him.\nI ordered the wheel to be put on and kept on, at the same time telling the Indians that if ever I found them moving it from its place without my permission I would chastise them most severely. Things went on all right until last night when I heard them moving her very cautiously up the track. I rushed up onto the bridge and made for them, but they saw me coming and ran away like a lot of young deer. I gave them chase and succeeded in capturing two. They were only boys, so I gave them a good shaking and made them drag the car back to its place. I had not been more than half an hour in the house when I heard her being moved again. I went out and called to them to stop, which they did. Four men had possession of her this time. They stood by the car until I came up. I collared the first fellow within reach, gave him a good shaking and boxed his ears. When the others saw me let fly my fist at him, they ran away like so many cowardly dogs. I made this fellow push the car back to its place and told him if I found any of them trying the like again I should take a stick to them.",

Reckoning the average width of the seam of coal to be two feet 6 inches\n\n\n\nLength (ft)\nDepth (ft)\nThickness (ft)\nCubic Feet\n\n\n\n\n84\n45\n2.5\n9,450\n\n\n58\n50\n2.5\n7,250\n\n\n40\n45\n2.5\n4,500\n\n\n32\n30\n2.5\n2,400\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n23,600\n\n\n\nReckoning 28 cubic feet to a ton this ought to have yielded tons 843. From what I remember of Landale’s report, I believe he stated that 500 tons of coal had been obtained in driving the tunnel.\nHe could not have measured the tunnel, nor the coal taken there from, or if he did he knew nothing about such things. From where they struck the coal up to the present manway (which is near to where the coal runs out ) is 300 feet long, height 7 feet 6 inches, average width of seam 2 feet 9 inches, making a total of 6187 1/2 cubic feet. Reckoning 28 cubic feet to a ton this would have produced 221 tons of coal - not one half of Landale’s estimate.\nThe foregoing calculations do not allow anything for waste which is very considerable.\nThe result of these figures show that 221 tons were extracted in driving the tunnel, 843 tons by Robinson and Branch making a total of 1064 tons.\nThe amount of coal shipped to Victoria was 300 tons: the amount of coal here at present is 350 tons making a total of 650 tons. Since there has been sufficient ground worked to produce 1064 tons and only 650 tons represent it this shows a deficit of 414 tonnes or in other words a loss of that amount in the shape of waste - Nearly 2/5 of the whole.\nThis great waste I chiefly attribute to the coal and slate falling together in the mine and the coal being the softer substance it gets broken into small pieces. A great deal of it remains in the mine, and what does not come out is shoveled over the bank as it would not pay to pick it out by hand.\nLet us now look for a moment at the cost of extracting a ton of coal; The average width of ground to be worked in order to extract the coal is 6 feet, that is to say there are 2 1/2 feet of coal and 3 1/2 feet of slate between the walls (the slate in some places is very hard) and allowing 2/5 for waste, a man would require to mine 94 cubic feet, this with the help of a laborer is a good day’s work. These figures therefore clearly show that every ton of coal costs $5 to extract and put it in the shute in the mine. Then it has to be drawn from the mine and cleaned, and then run down the upper tramway to the storage shute, then from the storage shute over the lower tramway to the wharf.\nI verily believe that were I to go into the minutae of the matter, a ton of coal would cost $10 before it could be put on board ship.\nThe Queen Charlotte Coal Mining Coy.\n“Limited” will declare dividends, when the Siwashes here leave off lying and stealing.\nIt would be a waste of time to comment at large upon the parties who drove the tunnel. Suffice it to say that, were they miners and honest men, they would have told the company to let the coal remain in the bowels of the earth and their money in their pockets.",

It arose out of a married man having slept with another woman - not because of the crime he had committed (for with them to do such as that is no crime), but because he had not paid her for having allowed him. There he sat in a canoe that lay on the beach whilst six women were blackguarding him. It did not seem to disturb him any; he sat and looked at them and said nothing.

    "text": "Sunday 11th December 1870\nShowery until about 5:00 when it cleared up.\nTook a walk round the Indian camp in the evening. Just as I had got into the last hut, a messenger came to tell me that Captain and Lady Skidegate had arrived from Skidegate Town and wanted to see me, so I made my adieu and went to receive my visitors.\nThe chief object of their call tonight was to get some more medicine for the old woman’s leg, which is much better and healed up in several places. Captain Skidegate is a very cunning fellow, and requires to be watched very closely.\nMrs. Skidegate appears very shy and bashful in the presence of strangers - in fact it is hardly possible to get her to converse at all, but when no third party is present she can talk enough for half a dozen - and an “Artful Dodger” she is, but I know enough of the Indian character not to be caught napping.\nThe Captain showed me a letter tonight which was addressed to Richard Edwards from H. Chater, and dated 9th July 1870. The substance of the letter was that he, Chater, had sent to Edwards by Captain Gold 8 lbs of tobacco and 10 lbs of pork. I asked him why he had suppressed the letter so long, and how it came into his possession. He said it was left at Skidegate Town for him and was not delivered to him by Chater. Mrs. Skidegate said that Chater had frequently told her that he intended giving Skidegate a paper of recommendation before leaving and thinking this letter was such a paper, they did not think it worth showing to me, but they had shown it at Gumshaew (sic) and there learned that it referred to Captain Gold. I called in Beardsell to see if he could give me any information with regard to the matter. He told me that Chater was one of the men who had gone down to Victoria last July. Being short of provisions here, he and other two (sic) engaged Captain Gold to take them to Gumshaew for provisions, and on their return, they learnt at Skidegate that the “Otter” had come for them, so they awaited her return at Skidegate.\nChater had, therefore, sent Captain Gold on, and given him these articles for Edwards which Gold willing had forgot to hand over. My opinion is that Gold and Skidegate divided the stuff between them, and suppressed the letter.\nSkidegate was very anxious to get the letter back from me, but I told him that it did not belong to him and as Edwards had worked here for the company it was my duty to forward it to him. He did not seem to relish this very much and begged that I would not mention the matter to Captain Gold. I told him I would not, but what Edwards might do in the matter I could not say.",

The consequence was that when the full car was pushed over the incline she ran off like lightning. I called to Beardsell to give her all the break as something must be wrong, and ran to the top of the incline to see. The hook fortunately caught round one of the cross pieces that support the foot plank and prevented the car from running away, as I don’t believe the brake would have stopped her without the weight of the empty car, and the chances are that the Indian would have been killed, also two boys who were with him. In order to prevent an accident of this kind, I had instructed Beauchamp, when he ran the car forward to the top of the incline, to call out all ready and wait for a reply before letting her go, and upon this occasion he received the usual reply of all ready. I asked the Indian why he had called out all ready without attaching the hook; he said the boys were bothering him at the time.\nThere ought to be a white man attending to the car, but I am short handed and this Indian has been accustomed to the work. I have however ordered Beardsell to see that the hook is attached in future. Took down 10 cars.",

He began to curse and swear at the Chinaman to pull the coal away so as to allow the car to tip and extricate his finger, but Ah Hen did not understand him and took hold of the car and pushed it back, squeezing Laiken’s finger. This made him perfectly furious. He raved and swore at him like a wild beast, and afterwards threatened to strike him. The Chinaman does not understand much english, but a more industrious hard working man I never saw. Poor fellow, he came to me in a great state of excitement and told me how Laiken had been abusing him. He said Laiken think himself very smart, perhaps he too muchie; me no think me very smart, you like me fight him, me fight him.

The rain has been pouring down all night, and still continues.\nMy head aches fearfully this morning and I feel very depressed in spirit; the thought of bygone days and happy hours, make me miserable.\nAbout 1:00 o’clock PM a canoe arrived from Skidegate with the intelligence that a ship was at anchor off Skidegate Village. I immediately hired a canoe and three Indians and started. After a pull of two hours we reached the ship, which was the barquentine “Lulu” bound hither for a cargo of coal. Captain Knowles received me at the gangway and expressed himself very glad that I had come as he could not speak to the Indians and he was desirous of securing one as a pilot to take him into Hastings, which I had no difficulty in obtaining for him. He introduced me to Mr. Carpenter, his chief mate, whom he said had seen my wife and children when they came on board. He expressed himself very sorry at not being on board at the time. He brought out the whiskey bottle and some biscuit and cheese, which was very acceptable as I was very cold and wet. I remained an hour and 1/2 on board. He wanted me to wait for tea, but the wind was increasing and a dark night before us so I declined his kind invitation, but begged a bottle of whiskey and a piece of cheese from him for the men.\nI dare say Captain Knowles would be thought by some to be a capital fellow, but my opinion of him is that he is a rough low life down east Yankee. I hope I may think better of him. One little incident made me look at him with astonishment: shortly after I went on board, who should make her appearance but young Kindawash. As she entered the cabin, he winked at me and said she had slept with him last night. I told him the less he had to do with them the better, and if he did not take my advice he might find out to his sorrow when it was too late. He replied in an offhand sort of way that he always made a practice of such things in every port, and he did not see why he should make this one an exception. Arrived at Hastings at 8:00 o’clock; we had it very rough. The men were very pleased with the bottle of whiskey; it was quite a happy surprise for them.\nI opened my packet, but fancy my dismay when I found that my wife’s letter was not in it. I felt like starting back to the ship. Had it been day instead of night I certainly should, but the Captain thought he would get in tomorrow, so I had to console myself that a day would bring them. I learned from Mr. Fawcett’s letter that my darling had sent me a box of Creature Comforts, so I concluded that the letter would be in it.\nWho can tell what a day may bring forth? This morning I was thinking of home with a heavy heart wondering if my dear ones were well, and now I have spoken to a man who actually saw, and brought a message from, my dear wife only 12 days ago.",

She was in great trouble; it appears from what she told me that after I left the ship yesterday her husband and a number of Indians went on board, also several women. The Captain handed round the whiskey too freely, making her husband and others drunk; the consequence was that they kicked up a rumpus on board which nearly resulted in a bloody fight, but fortunately some sober ones came off and got the drunk ones away. The Captain was drunk himself; he made the women drunk and then stripped them naked and treated them in a way not to be recorded. Mrs. Skidegate implored me to prevent a like occurrence. I told her I was quite shocked at the whole affair, and I should certainly prevent the Captain from giving the Indians whiskey. I fear I shall have some trouble with this blackguard captain. The Indians hitherto have been very peaceable: in fact my orders have been law amongst them, but they have such a thirst for whiskey that they would sell their soul for it. I regret that I am not in a position to hand the Captain over to a constable. Yesterday whilst I was on board he gave the men who were in the canoe with me some whiskey.

    "text": "Thursday 29th December 1870\nThis has been a delightful day; scarcely a cloud to be seen.\nWe had a fearful night last night. Shortly after I went on board it began to blow. Two of the Indian chiefs were on board viz. Captains Gold and Skaylus, also a number of women. The women however soon left after I went on board; amongst them was Mrs. Skidegate and her sister. I spoke to the Captain about giving whiskey to the Indians and showed him he what danger he was exposing us to by giving it to them. He expressed his regret at having done so, but said it was all gone so he had no more to give. At 8:00 o’clock an Indian came to the wharf and shouted for me to come on shore, a tree had fallen across one of the Indians huts killing one woman and breaking Mrs. Skidegate’s arm and leg. Captain Gold came into the cabin to tell me. I got up and prepared to go on shore when he came rushing in and said the ship had broke loose from the wharf. I told the Captain what he said. We ran out on deck. The Captain shouted let go the anchor and fortunately the chief mate was about to let it go when the order was given, otherwise the ship should certainly have been dashed against the rocks. It was blowing a perfect hurricane. The cause of her breaking loose was from the three piles giving way. These piles were driven for the purpose of making a ship’s bow fast to. They could not have been properly driven; one was hauled right out, the other two pulled underwater. The hawser of course slipped off and away went the ship. Captain Gold had his canoe alongside; I got into it, and he pulled me on shore.\nI made all speed toward the Indian camp; what a pitiable sight was there, men women and children, huddled together in groups along the beach afraid to enter their huts. I inquired of them where the sufferers were; they told me in Captain Skaylus’ Hut. The girl who had been killed I soon saw that it was all over with her; a branch of the tree had driven her head into the fire. She was a horrible sight. I examined Mrs. Skidegate’s leg and arm and found that neither of them were broken, but badly bruised. Her left shoulder was very much so. My attention was next called to a little girl about seven years old: she had been driven into the fire. Her little arms ,one leg and the whole of her chest was fearfully burned. Poor child, my heart bled for her. She was sitting blowing on her hands to keep them cool. I hastened to my room, got some Chlorodyne painkiller, Copal Varnish and Linseed oil. I gave Mrs. Skidegate a dose of Chlorodyne, bathed her shoulder and arm with painkiller, directed her mother to bathe her leg and keep cold water cloths on her left temple and eye (which were also very much bruised). I then attended to the little girl. They had put some dirty pieces of rag on the broken places which I found a great difficulty in removing, but she was very patient and thanks to my dear wife who had supplied me with plenty of old linen, I soon dressed her. Poor child, she seemed so grateful for the relief I had given her. Mrs. Skidegate was much relieved of pain by this time, and thanked me very warmly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMedical Explanation\n\n\n\nSee Thursday 29th of December 1870\n\n\nWhilst I was attending to these poor wretches, one of the huts caught fire and was burned to ashes. The Indians did not attempt to put it out; there were some large trees behind it which frightened them. I also heard a tremendous crash. I asked one of the Indians to go and see what it was. He soon returned to say that a large tree had fallen across the bridge and severed it in two, smashing 2 canoes and narrowly missing a hut where a number of Indians were. When I got back to the store I found 3 girls and an old woman standing at the door: they belonged to the hut adjoining the one which had been broken down, and there being several trees behind it, they were afraid to enter it. They begged of me to give them shelter for the night, which I did. I gave them an old sail which they spread on the floor; each took a chunk of wood for a pillow. They cuddled up and soon forgot their troubles. Quite a number of women sat behind the store all night.\nThe track was covered with fallen trees this morning, and the bridge is a great misfortune. I turned a number of Indians to clear the trees off, and some of the men to repair the bridge. The ship has been discharging ballast all day, she is moored safely again alongside the Wharf and will discharge freight tomorrow.",

They are greatly disappointed at the Company not having sent up goods to pay them. They have been working for a long time without pay, and have been looking forward to this ship’s coming with great expectations. It places me in a very awkward position with them as I fully expected a stock of Indian trade goods.

Fearing that we would soon have a fall of snow which would prevent our getting the coal down from the mine, I sent a party this morning to take it down. I instructed Beauchamp to exercise great care as the tramway would be very bad. When they got up they found a good deal of snow on the track, which had to be cleared before they began. They succeeded in getting down two loads, but it appears the friction of the car running over the rails made them as slippery as glass. When they pushed the third car over, it took a run. Beauchamp jumped onto the brake and tried to stop her, but soon found that he had no command over her - but he thought she would run down all right and stop at the drum. But alas!- in going round one of the curves she swung to one side and ran off the track breaking Beauchamp’s leg and thigh, also his arm above the wrist and dislocated his shoulder, one or two flesh wounds and the back of his neck so badly bruised that he could not move his head.\nThis accident happened about 2:00 o’clock PM. Beardsell dispatched an Indian immediately to tell me. When I saw the Indian coming running, my heart stood still for some seconds. I knew something serious had happened. As soon as I learned what was wrong I made all speed for the upper tramway, calling to the men to follow me. I soon reached the spot and found Beauchamp in great agony. I dispatched some of the men for a small bedstead and mattress to carry him down on. I remained with him until the other men came up, when I left to prepare splints and bandages. When I got down I went on board the “Lulu” and asked the Captain if he knew anything about setting legs, but he did not. I got a surgical book from him, which was a great assistance to me. The materials prescribed by it for such cases I had none, but got the next best. I tore up one of my sheets for bandages, and a piece of one of my blankets for wadding for the splints. I set the leg and arm, but the thigh was so much swollen that I could not find out where it was broken. I put a wet bandage round it and concluded to wait until tomorrow. The muscles of the shoulder were so bruised and swollen that I could not do anything with it; besides, I had no chance to get a good pull at it, from his arm being broke. I bathed the bruised parts well with painkiller, but he is still in great agony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMedical Explanation\n\n\n\nSee Wednesday 4th January 1871",

I would not allow the horse to be put before it until we saw how it was going to work. Made a long rope fast to it and told the men to hold her back, and see if we could lower her down gently. I locked the two back wheels with sprags, and started her; we kept command over her for about 50 yards, when she gradually gained speed until the men were compelled to let her go. I jumped clear of her just before she came to the first curve. Beardsell was the last man to let go; he was thrown with great violence against some stones which bruised his side very badly. She ran for a distance of about 300 yards, when she was thrown off the track at precisely the same place where the other one was upset. The men positively refused to have anything more to do with it. I am quite downhearted at the failure as I will not be able to give the ship a cargo without this coal, but our lives are of more value than the coal, so it will have to remain where it is until we get better weather.",

I told the Captain today that owing to the bad weather it would be impossible for me to give him a full cargo. He got in a fearful passion and wanted me to keep his vessel on demurrage. I told him it would pay him very well, but it would not pay the Company. The only thing I regretted that he would get pay for 500 tons of coal, and I could not give him that amount.\nI had quite a quarrel with him this forenoon. Yesterday I was on board to see how the coal looked in the ships hold. He called me into the cabin and asked me to explain something [not fit to be recorded here] to an Indian woman who was sitting in his cabin. I did so very reluctantly. It appears the Indians had been talking over the matter in their camp at night, and came to the conclusion that something must be wrong with [sic], the consequence was that three of them went on board this morning for an explanation. He sent for me and accused me of having told the woman yesterday something different from what he said, and told me if I did not take back what I had said, I would be sorry for it. I denied the charge of course and told him I had nothing to take back, and left the ship. During the afternoon he went round the Indian camp and exposed his person in every hut, before men women and children. Some of the Indians ran away, thinking he had gone mad. He tried to turn the Indians against me, but they only laughed at him. The Indians hold a great many papers from me, kind of promissory notes for labour, for which they will receive pay when the goods come up. He took a number of papers representing these, showed them to the Indians, and then put them in the fire, telling them that my notes were of no more value than these, and that they would never get paid for their labour.\nI regret very much that it is not within my power to hand him over to the authorities for punishment. Had he behaved himself properly amongst the Indians they might have believed his statements, but they only laughed at him and told him he was scatty (mad).\nOur tea is all done. The cook is burning barley and nicknamed it coffee; it is a very fair substitute.",

I read his Charter Party over to him and explained the nature of it, but he either did not understand it or he thought of playing a Yankee trick on me. Each party was bound in the penal sum of $3000 for non fulfillment of contract: I told him this was all he could claim, besides I had no power to interfere with the contract.\nHe used some most abusive language, and declined to carry my letters. Also that he would go to sea without signing the Bill of Laiding. I went on shore. He pushed his vessel from the wharf and anchored her in the bay, ready for sailing whenever a breeze would spring up. I have been trying to get my letters on board to put in the hands of one of the crew to deliver it to Pickett and Harrison of San Francisco, but did not succeed. I have an idea that he won’t go to sea without my giving him his proper discharge; he surely knows enough not to commit himself in this way. But I verily believe there is no crime too great for him if he thought he could commit it with safety to himself. I cannot find words strong enough to depict his true character.\nIt appears he made a confident of Riely: “birds of a feather flock together”. Riely is a great blackguard, and worthy of his confidence. Riely told me something that the Captain had said to him in confidence which made me very sorrowful. He must be worse than the very devil himself. Before recording what he did say, I will first relate the circumstances which brought about.\nOn the day that poor Beauchamp was so low and feverish, I went on board and asked him as a great favor if he would kindly permit me to look over his medicine chest and permit me to take there from a small quantity of such medicines as I thought would be useful for Beauchamp: he readily assented.The only medicines I took were a few James’ Powders for fever, about an ounce of Laudanum in case of violent inflammation, and about 2 ounces of Camfor liniment to rub his shoulder with. I wanted a little sweet Spirit of Nitre (he is slightly troubled with gravel) but there was only a few drops left in the bottle so I did not get any. I showed the Captain what I had taken and thanked him most heartily for his kindness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMedical Explanation\n\n\n\nSee Friday 20th January 1871\n\n\nNow what the Captain told Riley was that I had been on board and searched all through his medicine chest and took there from medicines for syphilitic afflictions. Fortunately the men were all in the house when I came from the ship and saw the medicines I had brought. They also saw me administer one of James’s Powders to Beauchamp at once. Riley, blackguard as he is, knowing this to be a lie told me what the Captain had said. I could not feel angry with him, but felt very sorry that such a monster should be going about in human shape.\nBeardsell’s side is very bad. I fear it will lay him up for some time.",

I went on board immediately, but found him in no better mood than he was yesterday. He again wanted me to interfere with his Charter Party, which of course I flatly refused. He stamped and raved and cursed like a madman. I jumped up, took my hat and told him if he could not conduct himself in a proper manner I would go on shore. He then quietened down a little and asked me to sit down again. I did so, at the same time telling him that, unless he would listen to reason and be a little more temperate in his language, I could have no further dealings with him. He listened to what I had to say. I then wrote his discharge, which he accepted. I received a protest from him which is not worth two straws, but it satisfied him, and was a matter of indifference to me. He then signed the Bills of Laiding and received my packet. I wished him a safe voyage and took my leave.\nHe got up anchor at 2:00 o’clock , but there was not sufficient wind to carry him out of the bay so he had to drop anchor about 4:00 o’clock ,only making about a mile.",

What between the bad weather and Captain I have been worried out of my senses. On the evening when we came down from the upper tramway after a fruitless attempt to takedown the coal, my beard and hair was white with frost. Beardsell remarked to me that I would be that colour by the time I got to Victoria. I suppose he saw how much it worried me. I will, however, give up fretting about it. I have the satisfaction of knowing that I did my duty to the best of my ability. It was surely against my wish that the ship had to leave with 65 tons short of a cargo. Four months of my time was up yesterday. I thank God for having preserved me in good health, and pray that He may grant that I return safe to my dear ones at home.\nI have not had much time lately to be much with Beauchamp, further then asking him every day how he was and asking the Chinaman if he was attending to my instructions by keeping the leg wet with cold water. The answers I got from both were very satisfactory. Last week I engaged an Indian to attend on him, the Chinaman and he having quarreled. Today I thought I would see what the leg looked like. The silly fool had actually pulled all the splints from the thigh; some he had burned, and some he had hid under his bed that I should not see them. The bandages he had left on, also the bandage securing the long splint which runs from the hip to the heel. I asked him what on earth had tempted him to do such a thing; he said his thigh itched so that he could not bear them on. I unbandaged the long splint, took off the other bandages. The fracture had knitted and appeared strong, but fearfully crooked. I showed him what he had done, and told him that he would have himself to blame for having a short crooked leg. He could not see, however, how he was to blame, but wanted to put the blame on the sailor who suggested the long splint, and was very intemperate in his language. He is an old fool and not a grain of gratitude in him. I made some new splints and rebandaged it, but I feel confident that it won’t come straight.",

All nature seemed hushed in repose this morning; It was beautiful and clear and not a breath of wind: began to rain about 10:00 o’clock, has been quite showery all day.\nA canoe arrived from Skidegate today. The Indians said the ship only crossed the bar yesterday: adverse winds compelled her to lie off Skidegate for a week. I trust she will have a speedy voyage. This ship has been a great disappointment to the Indians, Captain Gold especially. They fully expected that she would bring a great many “Iktas” to be given to them as a ‘Cultas Potlatch’. Our friend Trounce has been the cause of this; he told old Gold that his father was going to send a ship here for coal - a four master!!! , that she would be loaded with goods to be given away and he (Gold) would get the lion’s share. Poor silly credulous old Gold has been terribly gulled. I tried to console him by telling him that the ship that had come did not belong to Trounce’s father, but when Trounce’s father’s ship with the four masts!!! did come he would then have a benefit. He did not say much, but I fancy he thinks Trounce’s big ship is a myth. I don’t think he looks upon Trounce now as being such a great Nabob as he had represented himself to be. In fact, the majority of the Indians speak of him with contempt.\nI have frequently questioned these Indians to see if they have any idea of a Supreme Being. They all say they believe in a higher power than mortal man, but they are very far from the true knowledge. They have a terrible dread of smallpox; when that epidemic comes amongst them, they believe that God has sent it as a judgment upon them for their past sins, but they don’t look upon evildoing as a sin; the sin to them is in being found out.",

I asked them why they did so in such cold weather. They said it makes them strong and hardy. They have another peculiar way of making themselves (as they say) proof against cold; they get half a bucket of sea water, dissolve snow in it until it is nearly full, they then gorge themselves with this water and bring it up again like a stream from a firce (sic) pump. They repeat this again and again until all the heat is drawn from the body. Then they rush to the fire, shivering like so many young pups. This must be very injurious to them, but they think it is “hyassclosh”",

This weather seems to suit well for that purpose. They are hewing away from morning till night. The manner in which they make these canoes is as follows. After they have chosen a tree (cedar) which is very indifferent here, they hew a hole in it close to the butt. Into this hole they place a quantity of pitch wood, then set fire to it. They allow it to burn until the heart of the tree is consumed. It is then hewn down, and from this shell the canoe is made into rough shape. It is then taken to the camp and placed on the beach. When in this state it is usually about two inches thick. They hew it down to a proper thickness with a small adze. It is then half filled with water, a large fire built on each side of it and a great number of stones made hot, which when properly heated, are thrown into the water in the canoe. It is then covered over with mats and allowed to steam for half an hour or so. During this time the outside of the canoe is kept wet by dashing water over it. The mats are then removed and the stretchers put inside to bring it to the width they want. The stones and water are then removed. The canoe is allowed to remain in this way for a day; these temporary stretchers are removed and permanent ones put in. The canoe is now complete, and ready for service.",

The weather has changed it has been thawing all day.\nSome Indians arrived from Gold Harbour last night with a supply of halibut; This is a most delicious fish. When we can get it, we have it for breakfast, dinner and supper. Salt beef is at a discount when halibut comes into the market. The crabs here are very fine; they are a different kind from those got in the waters near Victoria. Oysters, there are none: those delicious pearly little creatures that we eat alive are dead to us here. Clams are in abundance, but they savour too much of the Siwash to suit my taste.",

He is a fine specimen of an Indian: his height is about 5 feet 7 inches; age I should say 35 years, well built, with strongly marked features. He said he had come expressly to call on me. Some of his tribe had been living here for a short time; they had spoken of me in such high terms that he must come and see me. I thanked him very kindly and told him that I felt highly honoured that a chief like him should come forty miles with no other object than to see me and wish me well. I had a long conversation with him. He told me there was coal at Gumshaew, but the outcrops were not more than an inch in thickness. After I had exhausted all my questions, he asked me to present him with a testimonial - which I did. Of course I knew nothing of his character; consequently I wrote him one which suited the Indian character in general. Then he wanted me to give him something as a cultaz potlatch: I gave him a few fishhooks, with which he was highly pleased. His son is about 15 years old, the daughter 19 years. They both resemble him very much; the daughter is rather good looking.",

Before going to sleep, I was thinking of my poor boy: whenever I would shut my eyes he was always present with me. I saw him as I used to see him in good health, merry and happy. This kept me awake some time. I dreamed that I had returned home and found my dear wife very sick. She was sitting up and in a chair: when I spoke to her she seemed too much worn out and exhausted to reply to me. I did not see any of the children and, strange to say, I did not inquire after them. This is the only time I have dreamed of home without seeing the children, and the second time that my poor boy was not sitting on his mother’s knee. Afterwards I dreamt that lice was crawling over me. How to account for this horrible dream, I cannot think. I trust in God that my dear ones at home are not sick, and are not going to be. The thought of such a thing makes me feel quite unhappy and miserable.\nEngaged a canoe and four Indians to take me to Gumshaew tomorrow should the weather be fine.",

    "text": "Monday 13th March 1871\nStarted at 7:00 AM this morning with four Indians for Gumshaew. The sun was shining in all his glory and delightfully warm for this time of year. The mountains with their snow clad peaks look very beautiful. There are six peaks in a range with Mount Seymour. The third one is much higher than Mount Seymour and shaped like a sugar loaf. There is a tradition among the Indians that this peak is an old squaw who departed this life long ago; the others are departed men. As we were approaching Skidegate the Indians pointed out a high mountain to the eastward which were they said was behind Gumshaew. There is a tradition amongst them that the island was level at one time and this was the only mountain to be seen, but I think it very doubtful.\nWe reached the bar at the entrance to Skidegate Harbour at 12:15 o’clock PM. Landed on the point and two of the Indians walked across to see how the wind was. They soon returned and reported wind against us with a heavy sea. The old man to whom the canoe belonged said we would have to camp here for the night unless the wind changed. I did not much like the idea of this, but of course I had to submit. During the afternoon I took my rifle and walked some distance into the bush. I came upon a small lake where there were numerous wild geese and ducks. I shot two of the former and carried to camp. When I got back the Indians had made a fire, which was very acceptable. The wind had increased to a hurricane and very cold. I gathered some dried rushes of which I made a bed under a tree, took supper of cold beef and bread, had a smoke and walked along the beach until about 7:00 o’clock.\nI have frequently heard miners say that they preferred camping out to sleeping in a house. This may be so, but I assure you I did not much like the idea of it, more especially since my only companions were Indians. Shortly after we had laid down for the night it began to rain. I had covered my head over with the blankets and soon went to sleep.",

    "text": "Tuesday 14th March 1871\nI have already had a surfeit of camping out. The rain poured down heavens hard all night, this making my blankets were perfectly saturated with water. I cannot say that I was very cold during the night: the rain falling on my head woke me up about every hour when I would pull the blankets over it and go to sleep again.\nI got the Indians to turn out about 5:00 o’clock this morning and told them to turn the canoe bottoms up so that we might sit under it. This was done in very short time, and here we sat until 10:00 o’clock when it ceased to rain, but still blowing and a heavy sea running. Having sat so long under the canoe, I was chilled to my very heart, and cold meat and bread for breakfast did not warm me much. Since we could not proceed on our voyage, I proposed that we should run back to Skidegate Village and there await a favorable chance as I did not much like the idea of camping out, and our blankets all wet. Accordingly we started for Skidegate which is about 6 miles from where we had camped. When we got about half way across the wind changed, favorable for Gumshaew. Consequently we headed the canoe for the bar, which I found out when too late was very foolish. The breakers running in over the bar were something fearful, and worst of all the Indians became so frightened that I was afraid they would not keep command of our frail bark. The bar where we crossed it is about half a mile wide, but we had a stiff breeze with us which enabled us to ride the breakers like wild duck. The only danger in crossing the bar in such weather as this is the danger of these breakers striking our broadside: in that case nothing could save us. But the old Indian who was steering knew his duty well, meeting every one bow on. There was one very large one; it came rolling on us like a mountain of boiling water increasing in height as it neared us. I could see the Indians sitting holding their breath to await the result: another moment and our little bark was half filled with water, but rode over it beautifully. The force with which the canoe fell as the breaker passed under her sprung a leak in her near the bows. As quick as lightning, one of the Indians had his knife out and soon stopped it with cedar bark fibre which he had at hand. Another set to work bailing and before the next one met us we were comparatively snug. The Indians seemed as thankful as I was when we got clear of it. We now headed for Gumshaew, but the wind slackened and a heavy sea running, we made very little progress, only reaching Skidegate Copper Mine at 4:30 o’clock PM.\nThere is an old Indian hut here where we took up our quarters for the night. The Indians gathered some wood and soon made a rousing fire. We hung our blankets up to dry which by the way took some time. I was very tired having paddled for six hours and half. I was very glad when my blankets were dry, which was about 10:00 o’clock.",

    "text": "Wednesday 15th March 1871\nCalled the Indians up this morning by peep of day; I had slept well and felt very much refreshed. Went down to the river which ran close by the hut and had a good douche with its cold crystal wave. By this time the Indians had made up their blankets and were about ready for a start. I soon ate my breakfast, which consisted of bread and a drink of cold water from the river; not very cheering in a cold frosty morning.\nWhen we left Hastings the weather was so fine that we expected to make the round trip in two days; this accounts for my running short of grub.\nWe got underway at 5:00 o’clock. It was a beautiful clear morning but very cold. I smoked two pipes before I could get any heat in me, but when the sun came out, and the exertion of paddling, I soon got warm. We reached Gumshaew at 12:00 o’clock PM, having had to paddle all the way.\nMr. Hardgreaves, who is in charge of Captain McKay’s store, was very glad to see me, but could not spare me any of the articles I wanted. He had only a week’s supply on hand for himself. This was too bad after having come forty miles for a little tea and sugar, and to go back without any made me feel quite dispirited. He kindly invited me to remain all night, which I declined as I was anxious to get back, and there was a little breeze springing up in our favor. I invited myself to take some dinner with him as I was rather hungry, but when he intimated that I would have to wait until he had boiled some pork I begged of him to make me a cup of tea as I could not wait for the pork. I don’t remember to have ever enjoyed anything so much as this cup of tea. I was quite a new man after it. He pressed me very hard to try some dried salmon and Indian grease, but the smell of the grease was too much. I ate a little of the salmon, and was satisfied. He eats this stuff as though it was honey. He appears very much demoralised, dirty, ragged and slovenly and very thin. He has not got even the time of day. I question very much if he knew the day of the week. It is truly wonderful how soon a man falls. He has only been six months stationed here and has already fallen into the habits of the Indian. He may wash his face occasionally, but I doubt if he ever combs his hair. God grant that I may never fall so low as that.\nStarted homeward at 2:00 o’clock PM, the wind blowing pretty fresh in our favour. About 4:00 o’clock the wind almost died away and it began to rain. On starting, our first idea was to make the copper mine and camp for the night, but we had such a good breeze that I ordered the Indians to keep out to sea and run for Skidegate.\nWe reached the bar at 9:00o’clock. It was very dark. There was not much of a sea, so we crossed it very comfortably. After we got inside, the wind entirely died away. There was nothing for us now but to paddle against a head tide, and being all very tired, wet and hungry, it was very laborious work. The old man who sat behind was completely used up. I tried to encourage them by paddling well myself, but it had no effect. I suppose they thought that when I was paddling the canoe was going along and the [sic] might take it easy.\nOwing to the heavy tide rips, the Indians said it would be unsafe to cross for Skidegate Village, so we stood for Captain George’s house at the entrance to Gold Harbor, which is about four miles below Skidegate. This we reached at 1:00 o’clock AM. It had rained without interruption since 4:00 o’clock; nine hours, so you may easily guess our condition. 11 hours sitting in a cramped position, and nine out of that under a pouring rain. When I got out of the canoe my legs were so stiff and cold, they refused to carry me. I staggered about like a drunk man.\nOne of the Indians went up to the hut and roused up the inmates. They got a lot of pitchwood, and in less than 10 minutes we had a roaring fire. I sat down by it, but could scarcely feel the heat of it. My teeth clattered and my legs shook until I thought they would never become still. Captain George’s wife came and sat down by me, lit her pipe and handed it to me. She kept feeding in pieces of pitchwood opposite to where I sat and tried to make me as comfortable as she could. The piece of bread that I had remaining was so wet that it was unfit to eat. She saw this, and immediately put some potatoes on to boil. I made quite a meal of them - yes even without salt. The worst of the whole was I had to stand by the fire and allow my clothes to dry on me. I knew this was very bad, but there were so many Indians in the Hut that I felt ashamed to strip.\nMrs. George spread a couple of mats in front of the fire on which I spread my blankets and laid down about 3:00 o’clock, weary enough.",

Mrs. George boiled some more potatoes for breakfast, and although I made my breakfast of them, they did not go down well. I was rather out of sorts.\nIt was blowing a perfect hurricane this morning and against us. The Indians said it was useless to attempt to pull against it, so there was no help but to wait until it moderated. When we landed this morning I understood there were only one hut here, but after I got up I found there were two. In the other one there were a family who used to live at Hastings; it appears they had removed to this place. They have only one daughter, a fine girl about 16 years old. For cleanliness she is quite an exception among the Indians. Her name is “Kitquini”. She did some sewing for me several times whilst she was living at Hastings. Soon after I had got up and was sitting by the fire warming myself, I was surprised to see her peeping through the cracks of the boards. I beckoned to her to come in. I soon learned from whence she came. Had I known that she was living so near I certainly should have asked her to share her bed with me instead of standing by the fire drying myself. I went along to the Hut where she was living and laid down, but could not sleep. The Indians were drinking sea water mixed with snow and vomiting it up again. This made me quite sick, so I walked about outside until the wind moderated, which was about 1:00 o’clock PM. We got underway, but having a strong wind to paddle against amid frequent showers of snow and hail, we reached Hastings at 5:30 o’clock. I was as hungry as a hawk, and made a hearty dinner. Bad as my home is here, it is superior to anything I saw during my trip, and glad I was to get back.\nThere is no certainty of the weather here at this season; it may be warm and sunny in the morning and snowing in the afternoon.",

We had hoped to make the bar, but the wind got up and shifted to N.W. which was dead against us. Consequently we had to put ashore and camp for the night. Our bread is exhausted so we supped tonight on salt beef and potatoes, after which we stewed a goose to be ready for breakfast.\nThis is a beautiful night, the wind is falling. Made up our beds on the beach. The Indians went out and dug up some shellfish. They resemble clams in shape, but are of a most delicate flavour. The shell is quite smooth and of an oval shape, very thin. Turned in at rest 9:00 o’clock, with a canoe for our canopy.",

However, he was clearly not working class and appears to have been well educated - as when Governor James Douglas seconded Robert Barr (who was originally intended to teach at Craigflower) to the Victoria School, McKenzie recommended Thomas as schoolmaster for Craigflower. Thomas, however, declined the position, choosing instead to remain at Craigflower Farm assisting McKenzie with management of the bakery, butchery, and flour mill. The farm supplied British naval vessels at Esquimalt with much of their meat, bread, and vegetables.\nThomas continued working with McKenzie after his PSAC contract expired in 1857.",

He appears to have been an improvement over his predecessor. At the yearly examination on July 19th, 1865, parents remarked that:\n\n“their children have learnt more in two months than in a year before with Mr. Claypole.”\n\nDespite this, in June 1866 the Superintendent of the Board of Education drew attention to the discrepancy between Thomas Russell’s $1,000 annual salary and the $500 paid to teachers in other rural districts, while simultaneously questioning his efficiency. The Board resolved to transfer the assistant teacher from the Fort Street boys’ school in Victoria to Craigflower at a salary of $750 and to dispense with Russell’s services.\nIn July 1866, despite favourable examination results, the Superintendent reported that Russell was to be discharged for being “by far the least efficient” and for lacking formal teacher training. Notice of one month was to be given.\nPossibly having learned of his impending dismissal and having not been paid for September, Thomas resigned abruptly on October 3rd, 1866, writing to the Colonial Secretary, dismissing the children, and informing parents that the school was closed. The Superintendent advised the Board that Russell had left his position to open a grocery store in Victoria without prior notice.\nThe rancour continued: when Russell later requested his September 1866 salary, the Board declined to recognize the claim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 1.4: Craigflower School circa 1865.

The Russells were pioneer settlers at Craigflower. The stone once stood in Pioneer Square.”\n\nThe main stone reads:\n\nIN AFFECTIONATE REMEMBRANCE of ROBERT HENRY Only Son of T. & S. RUSSELL Died at Victoria Sept 7th 1869 Aged 4 Years and 5 months  Also CATHERINE Their Younger Daughter Born March 4th 1862 Died December 7th 1880\n\nThere is a complex burial history. Robert Henry was originally interred in the Old Burying Ground (now Pioneer Square), where his “Lamb of God” headstone was erected. Ross Bay Cemetery records indicate he was later exhumed and reburied in Plot H72W12. Catherine was initially buried in Plot H72W18.\nPossibly following Sarah’s death and burial in 1905 (Plot H73W18), the remains of both children were reinterred in Plot H74W18 beside their mother. Catherine’s inscription may date from this reburial. When Thomas died in 1912 he appears to have been buried in the same plot, though no inscription marks his presence in this grave.\nThus, three members of the Russell family (Thomas, Catherine and Robert) lie together in the same grave in Ross Bay Cemetery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 1.12: Robert Henry’s “Lamb of God” gravestone with later inscription for Catherine, marking the resting place of the children and their father Thomas.",

    "text": "2.1 References\nThe California Gold Rush, which started in 1848, resulted in a significant influx to western North America of fortune seekers infected with ‘gold fever’. When two samples of gold from the Queen Charlotte Islands were brought to Fort Simpson in 1850, the Hudson’s Bay Company launched a series of expeditions to investigate. In late 1851 when news of the discovery at what became known as ‘Gold Harbour’ leaked beyond the Hudson’s Bay Company, a brief rush ensued.\nFearful of significant influx of American prospectors and loss of control of the area, British authorities sent two naval ships, HMS Thetis and later HMS Virago, to the area to check on the situation.\nAs it happened, a combination of the single gold-bearing vein discovered being quickly mined out, unsuccessful further prospecting, and a difficult relationship between the miners and the Haida Nation, resulted in the rush dissipating by the time the frigate HMS Thetis first got to Gold Harbour in June 1852. The following year the steam paddle sloop HMS Virago was in the Queen Charlottes to again check on activity in Gold Harbour, but also to lay down the law following the seizure, looting and burning of the American schooner Susan Sturges by the Masset Haida in late 1852.\nIt had been the original intention of Captain Prevost of HMS Virago to sail up the west coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands and enter Gold Harbour. He was, however, thwarted by inclement weather and instead opted to proceed up the more protected eastern shoreline. In doing so, the Virago entered Skidegate Inlet on May 14th 1853 and anchored near the large Indian village there.\nWhile at Skidegate, the son of one of the Haida chiefs, Captain Bearskin, took Captain Prevost and his Chief Engineer Bain to view a local coal discovery. This is the earliest record of coal in the Skidegate Inlet area. Nothing became of it at the time - which indicates that what was shown cannot have appeared to have been of much significance as one would expect the Chief Engineer of a coal burning vessel to have been excited about a sustainable local source of fuel in such a frontier location.\nInterest in the area was rekindled in 1859 by the exhibition in Victoria of a 14 ounce gold nugget that had been purchased by Hudson’s Bay Company agents from Queen Charlotte islands Haida. In response to this, James Douglas, Governor of the Colony of British Columbia, hired ‘Major’ William Downie to renew prospecting for gold on the islands, Downie being well known for his prospecting and mining activities during the California Gold Rush.\nDownie and a party of 27 miners arrived at Gold Harbour in July 1859. After a disappointing time prospecting in the vicinity of the original gold discovery, Downie turned his attention eastward toward Skidegate Channel where he again saw little of interest. Proceeding further eastward, he decided to turn back when the geology turned unsuitable for primary gold occurrences, his report stating:\nInterestingly, in his cover letter to the Duke of Newcastle (Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle, the Secretary of State for the Colonies) to whom he submitted Downie’s report, Governor James Douglas was less than complimentary of the Downie party’s prospecting efforts in the Queen Charlottes. Douglas wrote:\nAkrigg, G.P.V and Akrigg, H.B. 1992. H.M.S Virago in the Pacific 1851-1855. To the Queen Charlottes and Beyond. (refer to page 115). Sono Press.

This may have been what piqued the interest of a group of Victoria investors who, in 1864, sent a party of coal miners to Skidegate from Victoria to assess the deposit.\nThis first expedition met with difficulties and delays en route—taking six weeks to make the trip, having left Victoria on August 1st, 1864, and arriving at Skidegate on September 15th. They found outcropping coal on September 17th, but due to their supplies being nearly exhausted, were forced to depart for Victoria on September 18th without having conducted a proper assessment. They did, however, obtain\nFaced with this “imperfect,” but encouraging information, the Queen Charlotte Coal Mining Company “Limited” (QCCCo) was registered on June 5th, 1865. On July 6th, a call to shareholders was made for funds to underwrite a second expedition to Skidegate, which George Robinson—formerly superintendent of coal mines at Nanaimo, and subsequently a well-known photographer—was hired to lead. Robinson was also a “significant” shareholder in the company.",

    "text": "3.2 Robinson’s 1865 Field Report\nUpon his return to Victoria on August 11th, 1865, Robinson provided, on August 14th, a detailed report of the expedition to shareholders—as follows:\n\n“Arrived Skidegate Bay on the 22nd June. Early the following morning we proceeded to the vicinity of the Coal Mine, which we found to be 15 miles (W.S.W.) distant from the Skidegate village. We reached our destination about noon, and commenced our search for Coal the same day; but without success. We, however, resumed our search the following morning, and were rewarded by striking a seam of Anthracite Coal which was cropping out on the side of a high range of hills which afterward proved to be a branch of a mountain some two or three thousand feet in height and which, in compliment to His Excellency Governor Seymour, I named ‘Mount Seymour.’\n\n\nI afterwards traced the out-crop of the seam for some two or three hundred yards, finding it varying in thickness from three to seven feet, and of excellent quality. To this point I therefore directed my most special attention, and in the course of the next month succeeded in finding a continuation of the seam in two adjoining ranges of hills, lying to the southward of the one in which we first found it, but each running into or being branches of Mount Seymour. The entire distance from the extreme points at which the out-crops were found would be from one to two miles—having in each case the same characteristics, and being of a similar quality to that first struck, and from which I had some seven or eight tons of Coal extracted and packed down to the beach by Indians, many of whom followed in our rear, being anxious to see what we were going to do.\n\n\nSome five or six tons of this coal I have brought down with me by the sloop, the captain thinking it unsafe to bring more than that quantity by her; the remaining portion I left upon the beach. The outcrop of the Coal I found generally at an elevation of some five or six hundred feet above the level of the sea, and at a distance of about three-quarters of a mile from high water.\n\n\nI think its average thickness will be about four feet, exclusive of a few inches of soft earth lying underneath the seam and which serves as a ‘peeling’ or ‘corfing’. The paving consists of a hard brittle slate strongly resembling some of the slate found in the carboniferous formation in Great Britain. The roof has the appearance of a semi-vitrified sandstone and is much shattered and broken, which will of course render it necessary that great care and caution should be exercised in the working of the seam, to ensure the safety of the workmen. The seam appears to lie at an angle of about 70 or 80 degrees with the horizon, and is situated on the ranges of hills adjoining Mount Seymour.”",

The cost of opening the seam to such an extent as would be necessary to make it at least self-supporting will not, I think, exceed $1500, and after the work is fully and thoroughly opened, the coal may be produced for about four dollars a ton, inclusive of all labor, &., in the digging of the coal to its delivery upon the wharf, and should my views of the extent of the seam be realised (of which I have not the slightest doubt), I see no reason why any reasonable quantity of coal, say from one to four thousand tons per month, may not be obtained from the seam after it is once in fair working order.”",

    "text": "3.4 Robinson’s Proposed Development Plan\nRobinson then described how he envisioned the development:\n\n“For a distance of about 227 yards from the mine the ground has a fall of about one in five, the next 530 yards has a fall of about one in eight and three quarters. Over the whole of this distance, I propose to make a self-acting tramway, having a double line a portion of the way; so that the descending loaded wagons will draw up the ascending empty ones.\n\n\nThe remaining portion of the road has a fall towards the water of about one in thirty three on the average; but a great portion of it may be built upon a level if found desirable. There is no engineering difficulty whatsoever in the way of its construction, the only obstacles being from 150 to 200 trees and roots, half of which, or thereabouts, are standing and the others are fallen. I do not think that there will be a necessity for the removal of much earth in the construction, probably not over 500 tons in all.\n\n\nThe ground, however, is of a marshy character, which will probably render it necessary to elevate the road for the greater part of its length for a foot or two above the level of the ground, and if that part of it be built upon timber support and ‘corduroyed’ I am of the opinion that it can be built tolerably cheap, as timber suitable for the purpose can be found growing plentifully along the proposed route of the tramway.\n\n\nThe entire distance from the mine to the place where I propose to erect the wharf, following the line of the tramway, is about 2060 yards; the site proposed for the wharf is very conveniently situated, having 18 feet depth of water at about fifty yards from high water.\n\n\nOf the cost of erecting the wharf I am unable to offer any estimate, not having any work of that kind done in this Colony. I may, however, say that the beach upon which it is proposed to build the wharf has a sandy, gravelly bottom, and appears to be very good ground to put in piles.\n\n\nThe cost of building the tramway, including the removal of standing and fallen trees, will probably be about $10,000; but this does not include the cost of a wire rope, which it will be found necessary to use upon the self-acting incline.\n\n\nThe harbour is very commodious and is easy of access from both sides of the island, and affords good shelter from all winds and also good anchorage. Capt. Hallett, at my request, has surveyed and sounded the inner harbour, and I have requested him to prepare a sketch of the same, with such other particulars as may be necessary for your information.\n\n\nVessels of any size can go in or out of Skidegate Bay at any time of the tide, the distance from the entrance of which to the proposed wharf being about 18 miles, in the navigation of which there appears no difficulty whatever.”\n\n\nRelations with Local Indigenous Peoples\nWith regard to the local inhabitants, Robinson reported:\n\n“The Indian tribes generally who visited us did not show any ill-feeling, or anything of a hostile character; on the contrary they generally expressed themselves anxious for the white people to come and settle amongst them.”",

It is much to be regretted that all the money spent on this tramway had not been applied to proper prospecting the field.”\n\nLandale noted wastage and the unnecessary purchase of expensive equipment:\n\n“Tons of wood are lying rotting in different parts of the bush….. and many things purchased not by any means requisite for a young coal work, to wit iron scuttles such as are used in Staffordshire for handline iron ore, and as Mr. King informs me a lot of smoothing irons.”\n\n\nRecommendations for Coal Cars\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 3.11: Illustration in Landale’s 1867 report showing the recommended type of coal car to be used.",

    "text": "3.11 Superintendent Landale’s Tenure, 1868–1869\nUpon arrival on site in 1868 (month not specified) to take up residence as Superintendent, Landale found that the company had about 40 tons of “prime quality” coal already mined. He instructed continuation of the mine, which by August 1st had advanced 178 feet and was encountering variable, gassy coal averaging three feet thick, with 182 tons taken.\nAt the time of writing his report in August 1868 he noted 250 tons of good, clean, merchantable coal lying at the mine:\n\n“After the tunnel being driven 300 feet in coal 5 feet wide at the top and 6 wide at the bottom lined with 10 inch timbers and 12 inch caps.”\n\nAfter that he reported that the coal thinned markedly, but was not overly concerned, recognising that such variations were to be expected. He noted production potential for ten thousand tons of coal for five years.\nLandale was concerned that his November 1867 recommendation for exploratory work had not been pursued, with a different action having been followed which was less effective and involved unnecessary expenditure. Detailed plans for expansion of the tramway were provided with costings along with recommendations for future mining activity. Unfortunately, the maps and diagrams referred to in the available copy of his 1868 report are missing, which makes it difficult to follow his descriptions and recommendations.\n\nWorkforce and Provisioning Concerns\nHe was scathing about the workforce and voiced concern about the provisions:\n\n“In all my experience in Coal Mining I have never met with a more turbulent, disobliging, grumbling set of men; from the day we left Nanaimo till the day we left the island it has been one intermitting growl. The Company must be at any expense of trouble to smooth their path and make them comfortable, but not one jot of allowance will they make for the situation, neither have they done anything like a sufficient quantity of work, but I fear from the state of the provisions latterly that we cannot say anything, in fact we are at their mercy, though I do not think the provisions were bad enough to cause them to cease work, which they did on 10th September,….”\n\nHe further states:\n\n“Laiken has acted zealously and well, urging them by every means, but their constant song was ‘that was plenty for the grub,’ when the coal gave out ‘the place had no coal in it and never would have,’ and when it took on ‘I knew it, we have got it now.’ At present on what they call short allowance, the language is not fit for writing.”",

    "text": "3.12 Landale’s 1869 Report and Assessment\nHaving left in August 1868, Landale returned to the mine in June 1869 and spent a further six months at the site. His 1869 report, written on his return to Victoria in November of that year, details the work done at the site to map out the deposit; the main tunnel (apparently on Hoopers Creek) having been driven 619 feet, with some 800 tons of coal extracted and a forecast of at least 4,000 tons to come.\nHis report expounds on the work done to date and builds up expectation of profit to be made.\n\nSurface Works and Tramway Construction\nIn addition to the coal workings, the company had by then at various times erected:\n\n“A Store, large and commodious, capable of holding provisions and goods for 100 men with three rooms above. Dwelling house for 40 men with kitchen attached. Superintendent’s house of 2 rooms. House for oxen, Smith and Carpenter’s shops. House capable of holding from 15 to 20 people. Smith at Hooper’s Creek Tunnel, and a lodge at Wilke’s Tunnel.”\n\nA tramway had likewise been built from high water, 4,547 feet in length, of which 2,815 feet were straight and 1,732 feet were curved, consisting of:\n\n“697 feet of trestle work—level—1500 feet grade 2.93 in 100—640 feet level including a bridge 210 feet long—260 feet 2.9 in 100—1000 feet level including 600 ft of a bridge. And terminating at the end next to shutes with 450 feet, having a grade of 8 in 100 and in this distance there are eight substantial culverts and a turn out 75 feet long exclusive of switches.”\n\nHe concluded:\n\n“As far as the work on this tramway goes I do not believe it can be excelled in the Colony.”\n\nHe further reported:\n\n“The piles for the wharf are all ready, and a pile driver erected on a scow 20 x 40. The shutes for conveying the coal to the waggons was near completion when the last party of men left, one small tramway from Robinson’s tunnel was graded and the other to Hooper’s Creek must now be finished, so that with any ordinary weather the work must be in a state fit for rolling stock, and as there are several waggons and wheels and axles on the ground little time need elapse before the shipment of anthracite coal from Graham’s Island to San Francisco takes place, which is all that is needed in my opinion to make this a permanent paying and profitable concern.”\n\n\n\nSummary and Outlook\nLandale forecast in excess of 100,000 tons of mineable coal in two of the three seams recognised and summed up his report by stating:\n\n“The Queen Charlotte Coal Co possesses a property containing 6000 acres in which three veins of Anthracite are found, and it is now in a condition to make returns, various proofs costing large sums of money have been made, which proofs have turned out well for the slight depth on the vein at which they are made. A substantial Tramway has been built, with a large and strong shute, and a sufficient wharf is in progress of completion. A store and several houses, outhouses, Blacksmith and other shops are already on the ground, as well as waggons and mules.\n\n\nThe future operations for the consideration of the Company are the carrying on of Wilke’s Tunnel for the purpose of working the three feet and the Hooper Creek veins, and the opening out of the latter further down the range.”",

The departing Superintendent, Mr. Branch, whom Thomas Russell replaced, may have produced one; if so, it has apparently been lost.\nFrom October 1870 the continuing story of the development of the mine is taken up by Thomas Russell. As his diary attests, on his arrival he found the works in a poor state and came to question the integrity of those who preceded him. Some of the mined coal had been transported on the completed tramway to the newly constructed wharf, but it had not been properly sorted from slack, requiring time-consuming work to clean it, which resulted in slow progress and a significant reduction in saleable tonnage. The tramway was poorly constructed and in need of partial rebuilding, the mining was problematic, and the workforce of doubtful quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 3.12: Entrance to Cowgitz Coal Mine, Queen Charlotte Islands in 1902, 31 years after abandonment.

    "text": "4.1 Arrangements for Geological Survey Assessment\nIn February 1872 a group of 20 Victoria businessmen requested, through BC Government channels, that the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) conduct an assessment of the coal potential of ‘Queen Charlotte Island’. While recognising the importance of such a report, Alfred Selwyn (Director of the GSC) was concerned about the remoteness of the location and the physical safety of the survey party, stating:\nSelwyn instructed GSC veteran employee James Richardson in early May to proceed to British Columbia to continue surveys of the coal deposits on Vancouver Island that had been initiated in 1871. With regard to the Queen Charlotte survey, he left it to Richardson’s discretion to ‘take such action as circumstances might render expedient after his arrival in the country’.\nIn June 1872 Richardson met in Victoria with the Hon. J.N. Ash, M.D. and others interested in the Queen Charlotte’s Anthracite and made the requisite arrangements with them for the support required to conduct a survey.\nOn July 2nd Richardson left Victoria for Comox\nRichardson remained in the Comox area until August 22nd conducting geological surveys of the coal basin there. Then, by prior arrangement with Ash and associates, he boarded the HBC steamer ‘Otter’ accompanied by Mr. Fawcet, one of the BC investor group interested in the Queen Charlotte Anthracite. They arrived at Cowgitz August 28th and remained there assessing the coal deposits until picked up by the ‘Otter’ on September 8th for return to Comox.",

    "text": "“ In reply, I beg to state that I have already had under consideration the possibility of taking steps to obtain some definite and reliable information respecting the probable extent and value of these anthracite deposits. There are, however, difficulties in the way, which, unless the local government is prepared to co-operate, would, I fear, render it impossible for the geological party to effect the desired examination at present. So far as I can ascertain, there are no white settlements on either of the Queen Charlotte Islands, and they are inhabited by a warlike and treacherous race of Indians, so that only a strong and well armed party could carry out the requisite exploration with safety.\nThe Islands are nearly five hundred miles from Victoria, and from eighty to one hundred miles from the mainland, and as there are no established means of communication with them, a special vessel would have to be chartered and equipped to convey the party to the islands, and to attend on them while there. Under these circumstances, and also considering that almost nothing has yet been done towards ascertaining the extent and value of much nearer, and probably for present purposes more available, coal basins of Vancouver Island, I think it would not at present be advisable to incur the large outlay which from the circumstances above stated would be required for the exploration of these remote islands. If, however, the local government, or the persons immediately interested, are prepared to furnish the requisite means of transport for the party, and likewise to secure them from molestation while conducting the examination, there would then perhaps be no serious objection to granting the request of the memorialists.”\n-Appendix IV of James Richardson’s 1873 Report pp 85/86.\n\n\n\n\n\n“ Having procured provisions, camping material, a boat and men, and, through the kindness of His Excellency the Lieut.-Governor, a free passage on board the Dominion steamer Sir James Douglas, commanded by Captain Clarke,…..”",

    "text": "4.2 Geological Survey Published Reports on Cowgitz Coal\nIn 1876 the GSC published a regional map drawn by Richardson of the Skidegate Inlet area showing the location of the mine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 4.1: Geological Survey of Canada (1876) map showing the location of the Cowgitz mine and fossil sites collected by James Richardson in 1872, from the Queen Charlotte Islands.\n\n\n\nRichardson’s being at Cowgitz only a year after abandonment of the mine meant that he was able to conduct a detailed inspection of the mine workings as they had not yet been grown over.\nAlthough he did not draw a detailed map of the Cowgitz area, he provided a sufficiently detailed description of these works that G.W. Dawson, a famous GSC geologist who visited the site in 1878, was able to map them despite their being fully overgrown and much deteriorated by the time of Dawson’s later visit. A modified version of Dawson’s map is provided below with locations identified A-G to tie in with Richardson’s descriptions.\n\nArea A\n\nRichardson’s Report\n\n“In this neighborhood, Hooper’s Creek, which has its source on Seymour Mountain and meets the black shales at its foot, flows thence for nearly a mile south-eastward in the strike of the shales into Shallow Bay, about a third of a mile west of Anchor Cove. On the south-west side of the creek, the shales rise rapidly, leaning in a nearly vertical attitude against a spur of the volcanic rocks which have been mentioned as bounding the coal-trough. From the bed of the creek, at a point nearly a mile up its course, and 448 feet above the sea, an adit-level, called Hooper’s Creek tunnel, has been driven in a bearing N. 69° W., for 190 feet, through vertical beds of black shale, studded with nodules of clay iron-stone, which constitute perhaps a quarter of the mass, to a seam of coal.\nIt then proceeds in the coal in a bearing N. 53° W., gradually turning to N. 29° E., in a distance of about 450 feet. Trap rock appears to form the western side nearly all the way. The coal is good anthracite, and where first struck in the tunnel its thickness was from two to three feet, but it soon increased to a little over six feet, and continued so for sixty or seventy feet. It then became mixed with black shale and iron-stone for seventy or eighty feet, and in this portion the coal had to be separated by hand picking. The tunnel continued for about fifty feet further, but I could not convince myself that any coal at all was present towards the extremity. This bed is called ” the six feet seam.”\n\n\n\nDawson’s 1880 Report\n\n“Towards the end of the tunnel the seam gradually narrowed, and where the work was stopped Mr. Richardson could not convince himself that any coal was present, though it is stated in a report made to the Directors in 1869 that the seam where abandoned had again expanded to a width of one foot six inches. Mr. Deans also informs me that by removing the surface covering he has traced the seam, though in a broken and weathered state, some distance beyond the position of the end of the tunnel, so that there is no reason to believe that the coal absolutely terminates at this point. This outcrop called King’s vein was discovered by Mr. King in 1867, and after it had been opened by the tunnel above described, in 1869, about 800 tons of coal were extracted, and a portion of it shipped to Victoria.\n… In working in this tunnel the quantity of inflammable gas exuding from the shales was so great as to necessitate the use of safety-lamps…”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 4.2: Plan of Cowgitz Coal Mine and Vicinity Showing the Openings made on the Coal and the Probable Course of the Seam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipGeological Insight\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on Figure 4 of Dawson, G.M. 1880 Report on the Queen Charlotte Islands in Geological Survey of Canada 1878-79 Report of Progress p. 72, identifying by letters A-G the works described in Richardson J. 1873 Report on the Coal Fields of Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands with a map of the distribution of the ormer addressed to Alfred R.C. Selwyn, Esq., F.G.S. Director of the Geological Survey of Canada pages 57-61.\nThe area shown in broken lines is that occupied by igneous rocks interpreted by Sutherland Brown, 1968 as a Masset Fm. dyke. The land area without shading is Dawson’s Cretaceous Subdivision C (Sutherland Brown 1968 Haida Fm.) which is overlain by Dawson’s Subdivision B (Sutherland Brown 1968 Honna Fm.) represented by the dotted shading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea B\n\nRichardson’s Report\n\n“About nine chains on the strike of the measures from where Hooper’s Creek tunnel struck the coal, another tunnel had been driven at a lower level by seventy or eighty feet, and a third one about five chains further on the strike, and seventy or eighty feet still lower. On the mounds of debris excavated from these I could not find a trace of coal, which could not have been the case had but a small quantity been brought out. The inference is that no coal was met with, or so little as not to be worth working.”\n\n\n\nDawson’s Report\n\n“In other smaller openings, made lower down Hooper Creek on the same side, no coal appears to have been found, though it is to be presumed its horizon was reached.”\n\n\n\n\nArea C\n\nRichardson’s Report\n\n“About nine chains across the measures in a bearing N. 35° E. from the coal-seam mentioned, and therefore above it stratigraphically, there occurs another seam. The following is an ascending section of the strata which are here vertical :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLithology description\nFeet\nInches\n\n\n\n\nCoal, good anthracite\n0\n6\n\n\nBlack argillaceous shale\n4\n6\n\n\nCoal, good anthracite, called “the three feet seam”\n2\n5\n\n\nBlack argillaceous shale, with nodules of clay iron-stone\n11\n0\n\n\nGrey trap, or it may be altered sandstone\n8\n0\n\n\nTotal thickness\n26\n5\n\n\n\n\nA vertical shaft had been sunk in the seam, and a good deal of good hard coal had been taken from it. The top of the shaft is 540 feet above the sea, but, at a lower level by 193 feet. an adit called Hutchison’s tunnel had been driven to intersect it. The seam on being struck is stated by Mr J. J, Landale, a civil engineer and coal viewer, to have been thin. How thin is not mentioned. It is presumed, however, that it was not workable, and the excavation in the shaft having been abandoned before it reached the tunnel, it is supposed that the seam had diminished to an unworkable thickness in descending.”\n\n\n\nDawson’s Report\n\n“In Hutchinson’s tunnel, situated about eleven chains north-eastward from the Hooper Creek tunnel, and 430 feet in length, no coal appears to have been obtained, with the exception of a three inch seam near its mouth.”\n\n\n\n\nArea D\n\nRichardson’s Report\n\n“The strike of the measures immediately near the vertical shaft appears to be S. 18°E., and about eight chains in this bearing from it, there is an other, which is said to have been sunk in coal, but I could not observe any interstratified in the shale at the top of the pit, and there were but small indications that any had been landed on the surface. A third shaft is situated about three chains further on, and said to be forty feet deep. Here several tons of dull, earthy, impure coal lay on the surface, and I was informed that some bright, good coal had been carried away ; but I could perceive no fragments of it remaining intermixed with the other. Both of these shafts had been abandoned.\nTowards the last mentioned shaft, and upwards of 300 feet lower in level, an adit called Wilkes’ tunnel, has been driven from Robinson’s Creek (a tributary of Hooper’s Creek) sufficiently far, apparently, across the measures to have reached this coal, but the seam was not met with in it. At the extremity of the excavation, however, there occurred a black, tough, carbonaceous shale, with a black powder, a conchoidal fracture and an earthy aspect when freshly broken.”\n\n\n\nDawson’s Report\n\n“About thirteen chains below Hutchinson’s tunnel, also on the right bank of Robinson Creek, is Wilkes’ Tunnel, said to be 450 feet long. It appears to have been driven sufficiently far to intersect the coal subsequently to be mentioned as occurring between Hooper and Robinson Creeks, and at its end a black shale with Unio Hubbardi, like that seen in the Hooper Creek tunnel, was found by Mr.  Richardson.On the hill between Hooper Creek tunnel and Hutchinson’s, three small shafts have been sunk. In one of these good coal occurs,…… In one of the other shafts earthy impure coal was found ; in the third little or no anthracite was obtained.”\n\n\n\n\nArea E\n\nRichardson’s Report\n\n“From a report by Mr. Landale to the Queen Charlotte Coal Mining Company, it appears that some exploratory work had been done on Robinson’s Creek, above Hutchison’s tunnel. Trials were made in three places of poor, soft, dirty coal, nine and seven feet thick, and in two where coal of a fair quality occurred in a seam of two feet. But, unfortunately, not having been made aware of this at the time I was on the ground, I can only avail myself of it to show that the strike of the measures immediately beyond the mouth of Hutchison’s tunnel changes to north-east, and Mr. James Deans, my assistant during the summer, having been employed by the Queen Charlotte Company to undertake explorations on their behalf during the months of October and November, succeeded with much difficulty, owing to continued rains, in cutting trails through the heavily timbered lands, and in tracing these north-eastward seams as far as Slaty Creek, a distance of between three and four miles. The strata for the whole distance preserve their vertical attitude, and they are all along backed to the north-west by lofty escarpments of volcanic rock.”\n\n\n\nDawson’s Report\n\n“In three small tunnels made by Mr. Robinson, at distances of three, nine and eleven chains above Hutchinson’s, coal was found. In the first, according to a report prepared by Mr. Landale for the company, in November, 1869, the seam was three feet thick; in the second and third, seven feet, but ’soft, an expression which seems from the appearance of coal still to be seen on the dumps, to mean that though good anthracite it is completely crushed, probably by movement of the strata subsequent to its formation.”\n\n\n\n\nArea F\n\nRichardson’s Report\n\n“On the west side of Shallow Bay, about twenty chains below the mouth of Hooper’s Creek, the trap comes visibly in contact with the black shales, being apparently thrown forward a little to the eastward on the south side of a fault running about N. 73° E.”\n\n\n\nDawson’s Report\nDawson appears not to have commented on Area F.\n\n\n\nArea G\n\nRichardson’s Report\n\n“In a bearing S 47 E. from this, there is on the south side of the northwest arm, about a mile S. 30 E., from the wharf in Anchor Cove, and about 200 paces inland, what is called”Number Two Coal Mine.” It is an excavation of about twenty feet, bearing S. 67° E. on a seam between two and three feet thick of culm, holding lumps of anthracite. The black shale on each side of it is characterized by the presence of disseminated nodules of clay iron-stone similar to that at the Hooper’s Creek seam.\nMy own examination did not extend further in this direction, but it is reported by the Indians that a well marked seam of coal occurs about fourteen miles hence in a south-easterly direction, apparently agreeing with the general strike, on the south side of Skidegate Channel. This would give an extent of at least twenty miles to the coal-bearing strata which have thus been partially examined, and the facts mentioned indicate a general presence of coal in it, however much what may be considered the same seams may vary in their distances from one another on the strike, in their thickness and their qualities.”\n\n\n\nDawson’s Report\nDawson appears not to have commented on Area G.\n\n\n\nOverview Comments on the Coal Deposits\nBoth Richardson and Dawson were careful not to dismiss the Cowgitz anthracite deposits as being insubstantial, citing geologic complexity and the need for careful exploratory assessment prior to expenditure of significant funds for development.\n\nRichardson’s Comments\n\n“It is very probable that irregularities and interruptions may prevail here, similar to those which have been observed in the Vancouver Island deposits, and, according to the information you have given me, occur also in the Mesozoic coal-seams in Australia.\nIt would require a much more detailed exploration than I had time to give to pronounce with any chance of accuracy upon the extent of these irregularities in the Queen Charlotte Islands, but the possibility of their occurrence should always be kept in view by those endeavoring to turn the seams to practical account, and some cheap but careful system of trials along the outcrops ought to be instituted in the first instance to ascertain the probable quantity before any great outlay is made upon works intended to be permanent. This is usual even on the very regular seams of the Carboniferous era, and it is certainly much more required in coal deposits of a more recent age, which may have had their origin from drift instead of growth in situ.\nNothing can be better or more substantially constructed than the wharf, the houses, tramways, inclines, dumping-sheds and tunnels of the Queen Charlotte Coal Mining Company, and it is much to be regretted that their efforts have not been more successful.”\n\n\n\nDawson’s Comments\n\n“It has been supposed that there are in the vicinity of the Cowgitz Mine two or three distinct seams of anthracite, that on Hooper Creek being the lowest, while those opened on to the eastward and northward are higher in the series. It appears to me probable, however, that with the possible exception of small irregular seams, there is but a single coal-bearing horizon, and that that lies immediately above the agglomerates and felspathic sandstones of Subdivision D. The coal in Hooper Creek tunnel is found turning east, and probably bends round eventually to a south-easterly strike, running to the trial shafts above described, and then again doubling abruptly on itself, continues up the south-west side of Robinson Creek.\nThis structure may be, and probably is, complicated by small faults, which destroy to some extent its regularity; but by supposing its existence we account readily for the presence of the peculiar dark argillites with Unio Hubbardi near the seam on both Hooper and Robinson Creeks, the absence of the so-called three-feet seam in the Wilkes tunnel, the appearance of the trap-like rock on the north-east of the coal in the above quoted section (this rock seeming to represent that found on the south-east side of the coal on Hooper Creek), the similarity of appearance and structure in the coal seam in the section and that of Hooper Creek, and other points….\nFrom the descriptions above given, it will be evident that the coal seam is in itself irregular in quality and thickness. This has arisen partly no doubt from the inequality of the surface on which it has been laid down, but there seems also to have been a considerable amount of movement between the top of the already hard volcanic rocks of D., and unconsolidated sediments of E., during the flexure of the strata; which, while it may cause the seam to be very thin or altogether wanting in some places, may have rendered it extremely thick in others. Such irregularity, though to a smaller degree, has been met with in the now well known measures of Nanaimo, and if it can once be shown by more extended exploration that the average thickness of the seam is sufficiently great, this will be of comparatively little consequence.\n…\nThe locality about the Cowgitz Mine is exceptionally disturbed, and this by the duplication of the outcrops has no doubt caused an appearance of a great quantity of coal, and supplied fragments in abundance to the gravels of the various brooks. It has added, however, to the difficulty of tracing the seam, and greatly hindered its satisfactory exploration by workings. ’The great degree of flexure and disturbance has also probably caused the more complete alteration of the coaly matter forming the seam, but the character of the beds on the Long Arm, while more regular, is such as to show that any coal, even if originally bituminous, would probably there also be converted to anthracite.\n\n\nOn reviewing the appearance presented by the seams, it would appear that too great dependence has been placed on their continuity and uniformity, without the necessary amount of preliminary exploration to determine these points. The indications were not such as to justify a heavy expenditure in preparing for the shipment of coal, but quite sufficiently promising to render a very careful and systematic examination of the locality desirable. This yet remains to be accomplished, not necessarily by expensive underground work, but preferably by the tracing and examination by costeening pits or otherwise of the whole length of the outcrop of the coal-bearing horizon. It is, however, evident that the knowledge of this region so far obtained affords no ground for the belief that it is equally important as a coal-bearing district with Nanaimo or Comox, on Vancouver Island, where the conditions suitable to the formation of coal have occurred not only over wide areas, but at several distinct horizons in the Cretaceous rocks.”",

    "text": "5.2 Stratigraphy\nThe Cowgitz coal - an anthracite - occurs within a succession of Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. Intermittent uplift and erosion during deposition of this sedimentary succession resulted in a complex stratigraphy characterised by internal unconformities and discontinuity of depositional environments.\nThe exact position of the Cowgitz anthracite within the Cretaceous stratigraphy is uncertain: determination of this has been hampered by the complexity of the geology and the density of the vegetation covering the rocks precluding detailed investigation of it.\nAn increased understanding of geological processes since the start of scientific investigations in the 1870s coupled with the development of a regional geological understanding of the area through the subsequent mapping efforts of various workers has resulted in differing interpretations of the Cowgitz area’s geology by different scientists through time. For the purpose of this overview, the most significant reports are by Richardson (1872) and Dawson (1878) of the Geological Survey of Canada and that of Sutherland-Brown (1968) of the British Columbia Geological Survey.\nThe stratigraphy of the immediate Cowgitz area according to Sutherland Brown (1968) is shown below: The colors assigned to the stratigraphic units are those used in the succeeding geological map and cross section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 5.3: Stratigraphy of the Cowgitz Mine area of Skidegate Inlet: after Sutherland Brown 1968.\n\n\n\nExactly where in the Cretaceous succession the Cowgitz coal occurs is uncertain. It is thought to belong within the Haida Formation, though Sutherland Brown’s map shows the mine situated within the Skidegate Formation. Sutherland Brown comments:\n\n“…the writer also has no confidence that the coal of Slatechuck and Cowgitz is within the Haida Formation, and although it is within the Queen Charlotte Group, the structural complexity of this area precludes certainty as to the formation. Whatever the unit, it is apparently non-marine, and this may be explained by being adjacent to the active fault line from which detritus was shed into the basin.”\n\nWith regard to the nearby Slatechuck Creek argillite used by the Haida for carving, Sutherland Brown notes:\n\n“Some doubt remains regarding the precise stratigraphic location within the Queen Charlotte Group. It has always been said to be in the Haida Formation and could be in the upper shale member, but the interpretation shown on the map (Fig. 34) places it in the Skidegate Formation. Only detailed work in this region of abundant faults, complex folding, and relatively poor exposure in tangled logging slash could resolve the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 5.4: Geological map of the Skidegate Inlet area with SW/NE cross section: after Sutherland Brown 1968.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExplantation\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the cross section note the disconformities between the Cretaceous formations, and the vertical Masset dykes which cut through the Cretaceous succession and feed the overlying surface volcanics. On the map note the faulting in the Cowgitz Mine area between the north/south running Masset Formation dyke which makes up the spine of the peninsula and the Cretaceous sedimentary rocks to the east which contain the Cowgitz coal. The scale of the map is such that the detailed structural complexity of the area around the Cowgitz Mine is not shown.",

A younger Tertiary diorite dyke (Masset Formation- Sutherland Brown interpretation) immediately to the west of the coal was injected possibly along pre-existing basement faults which propagated through the Cretaceous beds. The contact between the dyke and the Cretaceous sedimentary rocks has been modified by subsequent faulting which appears to have affected the overlying Masset volcanics.\nThe original depositional continuity of the coals is not known: assessment of this has been hampered by the complexity of subsequent small scale folding and faulting as well as by the occluding effect of the dense vegetation cover.",

    "section": "5.4 Why Anthracite?",
    "text": "5.4 Why Anthracite?\nThe fact that the Cowgitz coal is anthracitic significantly increased its perceived value. For a coal to become anthracite it must be subjected to pressure and heating. This heat was apparently provided during intrusion of Masset Formation dykes and associated volcanism. The spine of the peninsula immediately to the west of the Cowgitz mine is made up of a dyke of diorite which intruded through the Cretaceous succession and fed the surface volcanics of the Masset Formation which overlie it.\nSutherland Brown (1968) states\n\n“The Cowgitz coal is apparently adjacent to the very large dyke of Masset Formation in the centre of the peninsula, and the contact has been the locus of later faulting.”\n\nDawson (1880) and Ells (1906) interpreted the igneous rocks to the west of the coal as being stratigraphically older than the coals – whereas Sutherland Brown (1968) interpreted them to be a large intrusive dyke of Tertiary age belonging to the Masset Formation.\nElls (1906 p. 29) attributed the anthracite to heat and pressure resulting from earth movement/faulting, stating:\n\n“The coal is in close proximity to the underlying igneous rocks which extend thence westward to the west side of the island. The rocks at the mine containing the coal are much broken up and crushed, and the original lignite of the formation has been converted to the variety of anthracite there found. This is due to heat induced by pressure of the shales and sandstones against the pre-Cretaceous igneous mass at the back. In fact, so great has been the crushing strain at this place that much of the coal, when mined, is found in the form of powder, and is quite useless for economic purposes, while, as in other outcrops on the island, the coal and black shale are so closely mixed that separation is almost impossible.”\n\nAccording to Sutherland Brown the heat of the Tertiary intrusion would have contributed to the anthracitisation of the Cretaceous coal.",

He was also involved in illicit trading, having in 1867 been convicted of selling whiskey to the Indians.\nIn 1868 he and the Thornton were famously involved in a clash with Indians in the vicinity of Fort Rupert near the northern end of Vancouver Island in which 15 natives were killed and 5 wounded.\nIn 1871, with partner Joseph Boscowitz, he took up sealing and over the next 16 years built up a fleet of vessels which hunted as far afield as the Bering Sea. This partnership ended in litigation and financial ruin for Warren and in 1891 he left the sealing business.\nWarren’s final business venture in the late 1890s was shipping passengers and supplies to the Klondike gold fields. He retired in 1900 and passed away in 1917.\nA comprehensive obituary in the Victoria Daily Times, shown in Figure 3, chronicled the career of this famous British Columbia maritime pioneer.\n\nHERO OF THORNTON EPISODE PASSES\nCaptain James D. Warren, Pioneer Sealer, Terminates Romantic Career\nWAS MASTER OF MANY COASTWISE STEAMERS\nOne of the last survivors of the pioneer sealers of Victoria, who lived to see his chosen industry become extinct, has passed in death yesterday at the advanced age of 80. Captain James Douglas Warren died at St. Joseph’s Hospital, failing to recover consciousness after an operation.\nCaptain Warren is survived by his wife, a son, resident in Seattle, and a married daughter here, Mrs. Goddard. The funeral arrangements are pending the arrival of the son, but will probably take place on Wednesday at 2:30 o’clock at the Thomson Funeral Chapel.\n\n\nA Remarkable Career.\n\n\nCapt. Warren was born at North River, Prince Edward Island, in 1837, and came to the Pacific Coast in the days of the Argonauts, but did not spend long at the gold diggings. He came to Victoria in 1858, when the northbound movement began, and has been a resident ever since.\n\n\nCaptain James D. Warren, whose career as pioneer sealer is contemporaneous with that of Captains Spring and McKay, commenced trading along the coast of Vancouver Island and Queen Charlotte Islands in 1864 with the Thornton and took part in one of the very lively Indian skirmishes.\n\n\nOn June 13, 1868 he was cruising along the shore of the mainland near the head of Vancouver Island, and was tacking near Storm Island when a small canoe containing two Indians came alongside, one of whom asked the Captain to go in and anchor, as they had a great many furs and desired to trade. Captain Warren did not care to enter and told them so, but while they were talking, two more boatloads came up and he gave them a towline but the visitors did not offer to make fast and seemed to be waiting for the others. They finally pulled in near the bow of the ship, and Captain Warren went forward and saw that they had about a dozen muskets concealed under some blankets in one of the canoes.\n\n\nFight Began.\n\n\nHe at once ordered the men on the sloop to show the natives that they were armed, and, when he exhibited his rifle, the chief asked him what he intended doing with it. Warren pointed to those in the canoe and told him that the first man to touch a gun would be killed and that they had better go away. The wily savages made no answer, and Capt. Warren informed the crew that he believed that they would get out of the scrape. The chief understood him, and at a signal all of them closed in, and the fight began.\n\n\nThe blankets were thrown off, and every Indian seized a musket, but before they had an opportunity to make use of their firearms, the crew of the Thornton began shooting, and two of their assailants lay dead in the canoes. Capt. Warren was aided by a giant sailor, known as Bill, and a man called Steve. Before the natives could recover from the effect of the first shots, Big Bill was on deck with a rifle in one hand and a revolver in the other, and his artillery, together with the two rifles in the hands of Steve and Warren, dropped four Indians at the next volley. Steve was severely wounded in the onslaught, and dragged himself to the cabin, leaving the others to fight it out. The Indian pilot of the sloop now took a hand in the battle, and killed two of his countrymen. Capt. Warren had a repeating rifle, was a puzzle to the attacking party, who apparently could not understand why it could seemingly shoot forever without reloading. The lively dodging indulged by Warren and his big assistant prevented them from taking effective aim, and when the last man in the first canoe went down before a bullet from the repeater, they withdrew with the loss of fourteen killed and six wounded, one of whom died the next day. Warren received a charge of buckshot, which laid him up for a long time, and the man Steve was seriously injured, but both recovered, and it was many years after this occurrence before another trader was attacked.\n\n\nPioneer in Enteprise.\n\n\nThe captain was the first man in the sealing business to send out steam schooners, and at one time operated a fleet of eight steam and sailing vessels. The seizures of 1886 and 1887 were particularly hard on Captain Warren and crippled him financially, so that he lost most of the accumulated profits of his many years of perilous work as a trader. In addition to being prominent in sealing circles, Captain Warren had at different times been connected with a great many other steamers plying the freight and passenger service, and in the early nineties operated the steamer Barbara Brockville on the northern route from Victoria.\n\n\nHe retired some eight years ago from the sea, but continued to show his interest in the subject till his death, and to old friends calling at the hospital showed that he had not forgotten the early days.\n\n\nHe was a member of the A.O.U.W. here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 3: Captain Warren’s obituary published in the Victoria Daily Times on Monday September 10th, 1917 Page 10",

There have been studies done that have isolated the bioactive compounds in the olive oil that help with fibroblasts (healing cells).\nTurpentine oil, easily available from pine trees, has been used since 2100 BC.

The Queen Charlotte Island Gold Rush of 1851-53 had prompted relocation of at least some of the villagers of Chaatl to the discovery site at what became known as Gold Harbour as they wished to take advantage of the activities there. Successive pandemics during the 1860s inflicted a severe reduction in the native population. This, coupled with a decline in fur trading activity, prompted consolidation and relocation of traditional villages on the west side of the islands to the Skidegate Inlet area during the late 1860s to be closer to their remaining relatives there.\nIn consequence, it appears that Thomas Russell met with a larger number of chiefs than could normally have been expected. He also encountered a changing cultural landscape with holdovers from the fur trading era and pressures from whiskey bootlegging by unscrupulous ship owners and traders.",

The village of Chaatl on the northern shore of Buck Channel on west side of Moresby Island was founded by families of the Raven and Eagle moieties from a long-abandoned village known as “Pebble Town”, at Second Beach near Skidegate. In the 1850s Chaatl had a prominent chief with the personal name Wadatstaia: the chieftainship was accompanied by the traditional name ‘Nankilstas’ (“he whose voice must be obeyed”).\nThe Haida settlement of Sqai’-tao was developed adjacent to Gold Harbour in response to the short gold rush which the Haida wanted to benefit from. It is possible that Wadastaia relocated at least temporarily from Chaatl to Sqai’-tao during the rush.\nWadatstaia became known to outsiders as “Captain Gold” because he and his wife were reputed to be the first to find the gold -which prompted the 1851-3 gold rush - although others have also been credited with this.\nWadatstaia was the brother of “Chief Skotsgai” of Kaisun, the nearest major Haida village about 12 nautical miles to the south of Chaatl.\nThomas Russell encountered both these chiefs during his stay in Skidegate Inlet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 1: Totem poles in the abandoned village of Kaisun (Qaysun).

    "text": "Dawson Whaling Stations\nThomas Russell’s account of his trip north from Victoria to the Queen Charlotte Islands makes a number of references to whales, which were abundant at the time. His Sunday 25th September 1870 comment relates to the whaling activities of the Dawson Douglass Whaling Co. Ltd. at Whaling Station Bay, Hornby Island. This company was one of a group of whaling companies active in the Salish Sea between 1865–1873.\nJames Dawson (1818 -1875) and his nephew Alexander Donaldson (1838 –1909), both Scots, had immigrated with family to the United States in 1842. Lured west by the Cariboo Gold Rush, they left Wisconsin in 1861, traversed North America via the Oregon Trail, and arrived in Victoria in March 1862. Initially they worked for E.T. Dodge & Co. freighting miners and their supplies with horse team and wagon on the Cariboo Wagon Road. By late 1863 the duo were running a successful turpentine business, refining that product at Rock Bay (Victoria) from resin tapped from Douglas Fir trees growing in the Saanich area. They sold this business in April 1866.\nIn 1865 the two, seeing potential profit in supplying the international demand for whale oil, requested pre-emption approval for land at Verdier Point just south of Mill Bay, Vancouver Island, with the aim of setting up a whaling station there. Approval was received on December 15 1865 for 100 acres\nTwo Kanaka (Hawaiian) men and a Danish man were hired to help construct a whaling station along the shore; small boats, fishing line, kettles, stoves and strainers were purchased and put to immediate use in catching dogfish. The healthy profits realized from dogfish oil rendered at their Saanich plant capitalised expansion of the tryworks, acquisition of larger boats, and a focus on whaling.\nThough Dawson and Donaldson were moderately successful in their whaling enterprise, they were hampered by inexperience and unsuitable boats. Income from dogfish oil sustained the company over the next two years.\nNowadays, dogfish oil might sound rather exotic, but the then massive dogfish population in the Salish Sea was a ready source of oil for miners’ lamps in the Nanaimo coal mines and as a lubricant for logging skid roads and hand saws.\nIn 1868, in a move to expand their whaling activities, Dawson and Donaldson purchased the forty six ton, 49’ long and 18’ beam schooner ‘Kate’ and fitted her with whaling equipment. They also hired Captain Abel Douglass (an experienced U.S. eastern seaboard whaler who they had met in San Francisco), with the latter to skipper the Kate and direct her whaling activity.\nThis increased their catch substantially. Dawson & Co. in 1868 processed in excess of 20 whales, delivering 10,000 gallons of oil (286 barrels at 35 gallons per barrel).\nBy the spring of 1869 the once plentiful population of whales in the Saanich Inlet area and southern Salish Sea had been depleted. That prompted the company to move and establish a new whaling station at Whaleton Bay (now Whaletown) on Cortes Island.\n1869 proved a bumper-year: the partnership harvested 20,000 gallons of whale-oil. It has been estimated that during the year and a half of operation on Cortes Island the company rendered 300 whales, mostly humpbacks. However, by the end of 1869 the price of whale oil had collapsed from a high of $1.20 to 40 cents a gallon.\nPossibly due to financial pressures, Dawson & Co. in late 1869 joined with the Lipsett Whaling Company to form the Union Whaling Company. Joint activities in late 1869 and earliest 1870 using the Lipsett’s Howe Sound shore base and tryworks were moderately successful.\nDawson & Co. commenced separate operations again in early 1870 and by May of that year the company had killed 19 whales while operating out of Whaleton.\nHowever, all was not well on Cortes Island. In May 1870 significant damage and loss were incurred at the Whaleton station when it was looted by the local population. Fearing the likelihood of further raids, the company in June announced its decision to relocate to Hornby Island.\nIn July 1870 Dawson pre-empted 100 acres on what is now known as Whaling Station Bay on Hornby Island and brought materials for a whaling station over from Nanaimo and Victoria, there being little of use remaining on Cortes. In addition to a try works (wood fired boiling vats for rendering oil from the blubber), a wharf, storage sheds, a coopers shed, blacksmith’s forge, a bunkhouse and cook house were erected.\nIn July 1870 Dawson & Co. changed name and format from a partnership between James Douglas and his nephew Alexander Donaldson to ‘Dawson Douglass Whaling Co. Ltd.’ Captain Abel Douglass became an active shareholder rather than just an employee and a number of prominent Victoria businessmen became shareholders and effectively took control of the company. The $20,000 share capitalisation was used to purchase additional equipment.\nThe activities that Thomas Russell noted while sailing past Hornby in September 1870 were those of the Dawson Douglass Whaling Co. Ltd.\nThe 1870 whaling season was very successful: in January 1871 the steamer ‘Grappler’ delivered, from Hornby, a cargo of 21,000 gallons of oil for shipping to England.\nFrom this point on, things started to go against the company.\nAfter a significant refit, the schooner Kate, renamed “New Dominion” in recognisance of British Columbia being due to join the Dominion of Canada later that year, was launched April 25th 1871. The schooner set off to hunt May 13th, but within weeks ran aground and was seriously damaged. At considerable expense, she was repaired and re-launched – and renamed Kate in an apparent effort to avoid the bad luck associated by mariners with renaming a vessel.\nIn May 1871 the name of Dawson and Douglass Whaling Company Limited was changed to “British Columbia Whaling Company Limited”. Notably, neither James Dawson nor Abel Douglass remained as shareholders. Alexander Donaldson remained as a minority shareholder.\nThe 1871 whaling season was less successful than the record breaking 1870 season. Total catch for the company was 12 whales yielding 300 barrels or 7,800 gallons.\nA combination of scarcity of whales, low prices and the company being sued resulted in notification in January 1872 of the decision to liquidate The British Columbia Whaling Company. The assets of the company, including the whaling station on Hornby Island and the schooner Kate were put up for public auction and purchased cheaply by its principal shareholders who continued to run a declining and unsuccessful whaling venture - which closed down in 1873.",

    "text": "His sojourn at the Cowgitz Mine in 1869.\nMifflin Wistar Gibbs (April 17th 1823 – July 11th 1915) is recognised as the first Black politician in British Columbia. He was elected in November 1866 to Victoria City Council representing the James Bay District, a post he held until 1869.\nPerhaps less well known is his relationship and experiences with the Queen Charlotte Coal Company, of which he was, by his account, a major shareholder. Gibbs was a Director of the company from at least 1866 – and had visited the mine site in that year. In late 1868 he resigned his company directorship to bid on, and win, a contract with the company to construct a wharf and tramway at the Cowgitz mine to enable the shipping of anthracite.\nAccording to his autobiography “Shadow and Light” published in 1902, Gibbs departed Victoria for Skidegate Inlet in January 1869 and remained about a year on site.\nThe following excerpts relating to his stay in Skidegate Inlet working on this contract are taken from his autobiography. Some of Gibbs’ statements and observations are open to question, in particular those referring to the discovery of the anthracite deposit, the working environment (which appear ‘sanitised’), and the shipment of anthracite via the HBC steamer the Otter to San Francisco.\nBeginning on page 101 of his autobiography, Gibbs describes how he got the contract, his trip up to Skidegate from Victoria, and his arrival:\nThe importance of a good relationship with the Haida was not lost on Gibbs:\nGibbs then describes the character of the Haida who worked for him, exhibiting perhaps a more measured perspective on character and theft than that of Thomas Russell: Page 103:\nCommenting on the climate, Gibbs states: Page 104\nThis is on contrast to the harsh snowy weather experienced by Thomas Russell, who in his diary for February 27th 1871 commented:\nGibbs described the construction project as follows: Page 104/5\nGibbs then proceeds to describe the non-indigenous workers on site: Page 105:\nThis is in sharp contrast to Mine Superintendent James Landale’s 1868 description of these workers:\nThomas Russell also had a very different experience with the various nationalities working with him…. certainly the ‘persistent and witty Irish’ in the form of Reily were anything but…\nGibbs hints at fairly rough conditions involving his workforce, alcohol and relations with the Haida women: Page 106\nAlthough not expressedly stating so, Thomas Russell’s diary indicates that the Company during his tenure was essentially ‘dry’ - except for festive times such as Christmas when limited drink was available, or when Captain Knowles was supplying, and even then Russell’s comments refer to drunkenness amongst the Indians and sailors rather than amongst his men.\nGibbs commented on the completion of the work as follows: Page 106:\nThomas Russell was NOT complimentary of the quality of work done by Gibbs on the road. On Tuesday 10th October 1870 he wrote:\nOn Friday 25th November 1870 Russell remarked:\nAnd, after expending considerable effort rebuilding the road, on Saturday 14th January 1871 he wrote:\nRussell was also scathing of the amount of coal that Gibbs and Trounce reported as having been mined: on Wednesday 2nd November 1870: he commented:\nGibbs states on page 106 of his autobiography:\nIt is interesting to note that James Landale, who was the departing Superintendent, made no report on the first shipping of anthracite on the Otter to San Francisco in his report to the company written on his return to Victoria in November of that year. This is surprising as it would have been a very big deal for the company and a feather in his cap. The Otter also was an unsuitable vessel to bring a load of coal to San Francisco, and would have been committed by the Hudson Bay Company to its BC coastal trade.\nDid this happen? It appears not…. As per Thomas Russell’s diary, and reported in the newspaper, the Lulu was the first to carry coal from the mine to San Francisco - in February 1871\nA newspaper article two days later indicates that was the first cargo of anthracitic coal emenating from the Pacific side of North America.",

    "text": "Image 1: Miflin Wistar Gibbs: portrait in his autobiography “Shadow and Light”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The only mine of importance in British Columbia previous to 1867 was at Nanaimo, where there was a large output of bituminous coal. In that year anthracite was discovered by Indians building a fire on a broken vein that ran from Mt. Seymour on Queen Charlotte Island, in the North Pacific. It was a high grade of coal, and on account of its density and burning without flame, was the most valuable for smelting and domestic purposes.\n\n\nA company had been formed at Victoria which had spent $60,000 prospecting for an enduring and paying vein, and thereafter prepared for development by advertising for tenders to build a railroad and wharfs for shipping. Being a large shareholder in the company, I resigned as a director and bid. It was not the lowest, but I was awarded the contract. The Hudson Bay Co. steamship Otter, having been chartered January 1869, with fifty men, comprising surveyor, carpenters, blacksmiths, and laborers, with timber, rails, provisions, and other necessities for the work I embarked at Victoria. Queen Charlotte Island was at that time almost a ’terra incognito,” sparsely inhabited solely by scattered tribes of Indians on the coast lines, which were only occasionally visited by her Majesty’s ships for discovery and capture of small craft engaged in the whisky trade.\n\n\nPassing through the Straits of Georgia, stopping at Fort Simpson, and then to Queen Charlotte Island, entering the mouth of Skidegate River, a few miles up, we reached the company’s quarters, consisting of several wooden buildings for residence, stores, shops, etc. At the mouth and along the river were several Indian settlements, comprising huts, the sides of which were rough riven planks, with roof of leaves of a tough fibrous nature. At the crest was an opening for the escape of smoke from fires built on the ground in the centre of the enclosure. As the ship passed slowly up the river we were hailed by the shouting of the Indians, who ran to the river side, got in their canoes and followed in great numbers until we anchored. Then they swarmed around and over the ship, saluting the ship’s company as “King George’s men,” for such the English are known and called by them. They were peaceful and docile, lending ready hands to our landing and afterwards to the cargo. I was surprised, while standing on the ship, to hear my name called by an Indian in a canoe at the side, coupled with encomiums of the native variety, quite flattering. It proved to be one who had been a domestic in my family at Victoria.”\n\n\n\n“He gave me kind welcome, not to be ignored, remembering that I was in “the enemy’s country,” so to speak. Besides, such a reception was so much more desirable, as I was dependent upon native labor for excavating and transportation of heavy material along the line of the road.”\n\n\n\n“While their work was not despatched with celerity of trained labor, still, as is general with labor, they earned all they got. “One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.” I found many apt, some stupid; honesty and dishonesty in usual quantities, with craft peculiar to savage life.\n\n\nTheir mode of stealing by stages was peculiar. The thing coveted was first hid nearby; if no enquiry was made for a period deemed sufficiently long the change of ownership became complete and its removal to their own hut followed, to be disposed of when opportunity offered. If you had a particle of evidence and made a positive accusation, with the threat of “King George’s man-of-war,” it was likely to be forthcoming by being placed secretly nearby its proper place. But through it we see the oneness of human frailty, whether in the watered stock of the corporation or that of its humble servitor the milkman, there is kinship. To get something for nothing is the “ignis fatuus” ever in the lead.\n\n\nMy experience during a year’s stay on the island, and constant intercourse with the natives, impressed me more and more with the conviction that we are all mainly creatures of environments; yet all through the strata and fibre of human nature there is a chord that beats responsive to kindness – a “language that the dumb can speak, and that the deaf can understand.”\n\n\n\n“The climate of the island was much more pleasant than expected. The warm ocean currents on the Pacific temper the atmosphere, rendering it more genial than the same degree of latitude on the Atlantic. A few inches of snow, a thin coat of ice on the river, were the usual attendants of winter. But more frequently our camp was overhung by heavy clouds, broken by Mt. Seymour, precipitating much rain.”\n\n\n\n“Gibbs was exceedingly fortunate. the Indians tell men [sic] they had only one fall of snow, and so light that it did not last a week. Had last winter been like this, he could not have completed his contract until midsummer.”\n\n\n\n“After being domiciled we proceeded with the resident superintendent to view the company’s property, comprising several thousand acres. Rising in altitude, and on several levels, as we approached Mt. Seymour, croppings of coal were quite frequent, the broken and scattered veins evidencing volcanic disturbance. The vein most promising was several hundred feet above the level of the sea, and our intended wharf survey was made, which showed heavy cuttings and blasting to obtain grade for the road. The work was pushed with all the vigour the isolated locality and climatic conditions allowed. Rain almost incessant was a great impediment, as well as were the occasional strikes of the Indian labor, which was never for more wages, but for more time. The coal from the croppings which had been at first obtained for testing, had been carried by them in bags, giving them in the “coin of the realm’ so many pieces of tobacco for each bag delivered on ship*. There was plenty of time lying around on those trips, and they took it. On the advent of the new era** they complained that “King George men” took all the time and gave them none, so they frequently quit to go in quest….”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNotes\n\n\n\n*Robinson reported the Indians packing seven or eight tons of coal down to the beach when sampling it during his exploratory visit in June 1865 – see ‘QCCCo Appraisal of and Moves to Develop the Cowgitz Coal Deposit’ in this manuscript.\n**Apparently this refers to the Indians having to work continuously during the construction of the tramway rather than having frequent breaks during the carrying of the coal from mine to ship during the initial sampling.\n\n\n\n\n“The nativity of my skilled labor was a piece of national patchwork – a composite of the canny Scotch, the persistent and witty Irish, the conservative, but indomitable English, the effervescent French, the phlegmatic German and the irascible Italian. I found this variety beneficial, for the usual national and race bias was sufficiently in evidence to preclude a combination to retard the work. I had three Americans, that were neither white nor colored; they were born black; ….”\n\n\n\n“In all my experience in Coal Mining I have never met with a more turbulent, disobliging, grumbling set of men; from the day we left Nanaimo till the day we left the island it has been one intermitting growl….”\n\n\n\n\n“The conditions there were such that threw many of my men off their feet. Women and liquor had much the “right of way.”\n\n\n\n\n“Miners had been at work placing many tons of coal at the mouth of the mine during the making of the road, the grade of which was of two elevations, one from the mine a third of the distance, terminating at a chute, from which the coal fell to cars on the lower level, and from thence to the wharf.”\n\n\n\n“There appears to me to have been a great deal of money uselessly spent. In fact in my opinion the only piece of work worth the money expended on it is the lower tramway, and that is not by any means a good workable road. The storage shute is not worthy of the name applied to it; the coal has a drop of 18 feet after it passes over the screen. Now it stands to reason that coal falling from this height must get smashed to atoms. Mr. Branch says there are 300 tons in it, but it is in a fearful mess with dirt, in fact it appeared to me to be a moral impossibility to clean it. The upper tramway is a shameful piece of work, I cannot think how a man like Mr. Trounce with his experience could have taken off Gibb’s hands as a workable road. It has caved at the last curve where you come in sight of the mine. From this point nearly to the mouth of the tunnel it is built on the side of the mountain and about 80 feet above the level of the creek. It appears to be pretty well cribbed except at the curve where it has caved. It is not cribbed at all here, but simply several long trees thrown down held up at one end by the root of a tree and at the other by a stake driven in; this stake only measures 4 inches in diameter, a match stuck in would have suited about as well.”\n\n\n\n“The caved part of the road looks as though it will soon tumble into the creek; I wish Trounce and Gibbs were here now to repair it. I feel quite exasperated when I think of Trounce being paid $200 a month as Inspector of Contracts and accepting such a road as this, that has not stood more than nine months and is now impassable. He surely never could have inspected the work, because any man of common sense could have seen that a road built in this way would not stand.”\n\n\n\n“I wish Trounce and Gibbs were here now to work this beautiful road.”\n\n\n\n“Branch was a long way out of his calculation when he said there were 300 tons in the shute, we haven’t taken out 200 tons yet and I don’t think there is much more than 50 tons left in it. I don’t believe it will yield more than 200 tons of clean coal. Should a ship come we will be in a pretty mess, but I sincerely hope she will not come for some time yet. Both Gibbs and Trounce must have given a false report as to the quantity of coal mined.”\n\n\n\n“After completion of the road and its acceptance by the superintendent and the storage of a cargo of coal on the wharf, the steamer Otter arrived*, was loaded, and despatched to San Francisco, being the first cargo of anthracite coal ever unearthed on the Pacific seaboard.\n\n\nThe superintendent, having notified the directors at Victoria of his intention to return, they had appointed me to assume the office. I was so engaged, preparing for the next shipment on the steamer.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNotes\n\n\n\n*This would have been in late October or early November 1869.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 2: Victoria Daily Standard Tuesday February 14th 1871 page 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 3: Victoria Daily Standard Thursday February 16th 1871 page 3.",

    "text": "Something in common\nOne thing that Gibbs and Russell did have in common was a life threatening canoe trip.\nGibbs in his autobiography describes his experience in florid style: Page 107:\n\n“My sojourn on the island was not without its vicissitudes and dangers, and one of the latter I shall ever remember – one mingled, as it was, with antics of Neptune, that capricious god of the ocean, and resignation to what seemed to promise my end with all things sublime.\n\n\nThe stock of oil brought for lubricating cars and machinery having been exhausted, I started a beautiful morning in a canoe with three Indians for their settlement at the mouth of Skidegate River for a temporary supply. After a few hours paddling, gliding down the river serenely, the wind suddenly arose, increasing in force as we approached the mouth of the gulf. The high walls of the river sides afforded no opportunity to land. The storm continued to increase in violence, bringing billows of rough sea from the ocean, our canoe dancing like a feather, one moment on a high crest by its skyward leap, and in the next to an abyss deep, with walls of sea on either side, shutting out a view of the horizon, while I, breathless with anxious hope, waited for the succeeding wave to again lift the frail bark.\n\n\nThe better to preserve the equilibrium of the canoe – a treacherous conveyance at the best – wrapped in a blanket in the bottom of the canoe I laid, looking into the faces of the Indians, contorted by fright, and listened to their peculiar death wail, “while the gale whistled aloft his tempest tune.” I afterward learned that they had a superstition based upon the loss of many of their tribe under like conditions, that escape was impossible. The alarm and distrust in men, aquatic from birth, in their own waters was to me appalling.\n\n\nI seemed to have ”looked death in the face” – and what a rush of recollections that had been long forgotten, of actions good and bad, the latter seeming the most, hurried, serried, but distinct through my excited brain; then a thought, bringing a calm content that “To every man upon this earth death cometh soon or late:” and with a fervent resignation of myself to God and to what I believed to be inevitable; then a lull in the wind, and, after many attempts, we were able to cross the mouth of the river to the other side – the place of destination.”\n\nMiflin Gibbs left the mine at Skidegate Inlet for Victoria in late 1869. He proceeded to liquidate the majority of his holdings and in 1870 returned to the States to join his wife and family who had left Victoria in 1867.",
