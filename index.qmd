# **About This Book** {#sec-preface .unnumbered}

The text of the diaries is presented without interruption, to allow the reader to follow the day to day commentaries in a continuous manner – and to avoid mixing modern commentary with Thomas Russell’s written words.

Maps showing the Thornton’s progress journeying up to Skidegate Inlet from Victoria, and of Thomas Russell’s canoe trips to Cumshewa and Masset have been created so the reader unfamiliar with the region can follow. Background information on the persons and places identified in the diaries can be accessed by clicking on ‘active words’ within Thomas Russell’s text.

This book includes chapters pertaining to technical aspects of the Cowgitz coal/anthracite.

## Transcription Methodology {#sec-transcription}
Transcription of the diaries from Thomas Russell’s handwritten notebooks to electronic format was aided by use of the dictation facility within Microsoft Word. 

Thomas Russell’s original punctuation proved a little challenging and was somewhat edited, care being taken, however, to ensure retention of his original meaning and as much as possible his original sentence structure.

Generally Thomas’ handwriting is easily read. The few illegible words and sentences – most occurring in the fourth pencil-written volume, likely resulting from writing in difficult outdoor circumstances - have been identified as either ‘illegible’ or with a question mark before the ?word where a possible deciphering has been proposed.

Obvious spelling errors for common words were corrected. Mis-spellings of names were retained, several one of these causing impediment to researching them (Swannee for Suwanee).
